   Abstract = {Quantum dots (QDs) have a number of unique optical properties that are advantageous in the development of bioanalyses based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Researchers have used QDs as energy donors in FRET schemes for the analysis of nucleic acids, proteins, proteases, haptens, and other small molecules. This paper reviews these applications of QDs. Existing FRET technologies can potentially be improved by using QDs as energy donors instead of conventional fluorophores. Superior brightness, resistance to photobleaching, greater optimization of FRET efficiency, and/or simplified multiplexing are possible with QD donors. The applicability of the Forster formalism to QDs and the feasibility of using QDs as energy acceptors are also reviewed.},

Measuring the distance between the RNA 5' end and three known locations within the elongation complex allows us determine its position by means of triangulation. RNA leaves the polymerase active center cleft via the previously proposed exit tunnel and then disengages from the enzyme surface. When the RNA reaches lengths of 26 and 29 nt, its 5' end associates with Pol II at the base of the dock domain. Because the initiation factor TFIIB binds to the dock domain and exit tunnel, exiting RNA may prevent TFIIB reassociation during elongation. RNA further extends toward the linker connecting to the polymerase C-terminal repeat domain (CTD), which binds the 5'-capping enzyme and other RNA processing factors.},

Here we used single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) experiments to locate nontemplate and upstream DNA with our recently developed Nano Positioning System (NPS). In the resulting complete model of the Pol II EC, separation of the nontemplate from the template strand at position +2 involves interaction with fork loop 2. The nontemplate strand passes loop beta10-beta11 on the Pol II lobe, and then turns to the other side of the cleft above the rudder. The upstream DNA duplex exits at an approximately right angle from the incoming downstream DNA, and emanates from the cleft between the protrusion and clamp. Comparison with published data suggests that the architecture of the complete EC is conserved from bacteria to eukaryotes and that upstream DNA is relocated during the initiation-elongation transition.},

   Abstract = {We establish a probability distribution analysis (PDA) method for the analysis of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals to determine with high precision the originating value of a shot-noise-limited signal distribution. PDA theoretical distributions are calculated explicitly including crosstalk, stochastic variations, and background and represent the minimum width that a FRET distribution must have. In this way an unambiguous distinction is made between shot-noise distributions and distributions broadened by heterogeneities. This method simultaneously and effectively extracts highly resolved information from FRET distributions. The theoretical histograms match the exact profile of histograms generated from constant transfer efficiency experimental data with a chi2 near unity. The chi2 surface suggests an ultimate level of precision with FRET of < 1% of the Forster radius. Distributions of FRET signals in donor-acceptor-labeled DNA were unambiguously identified as being broader than shot-noise variations could explain. A model describing a Gaussian distribution of distances was tested with the PDA method and demonstrated 5 A inhomogeneities due to dye motions. The capability of this method to recover quantitative information from FRET distributions has potential applications for studying molecular conformations and dynamics. Potential sources for artifacts such as acceptor photobleaching, spectrally different observation volumes, and fluctuations of the Forster radius are ruled out.},

   Abstract = {The temperature dependence of fluorescence emission and photoisomerization of five symmetric carbocyanines was studied in a group of primary n-alcohols from 0 to 70-degrees-C. The trans-cis isomerization on the excited state potential surface was studied by steady-state fluorescence emission and flash photolysis.  The back isomerization rate constant on the ground-state potential surface from the photoisomer to the normal form was also studied by flash photolysis. In all cases fluorescence quantum yields were found to diminish with temperature and to increase with viscosity (eta), while isomerization quantum yields showed the opposite behavior. All deactivation rate constants of the excited singlet state were calculated, and activation energies for the processes of excited and ground states were obtained. The solvent does not affect radiative and internal conversion rate constants of the excited singlet state. The only effect of the solvent on the isomerization rates (k(iso)) of both processes is through eta.  Results indicate that the dependence of k(iso) on eta is k(iso) = f(eta)exp(-E0/RT), where E0 was found to be solvent independent. Fits of f(eta) by the Kramers equation (Physica 1940, 7, 284) and by an activation-volume-based model were performed. Kramers's equation provides a good fit of the data for the carbocyanines with the smallest E0, but for other cases it shows systematic deviations already reported for other carbocyanines, which are discussed on the basis of the hypothesis involved in the model. The activation-volume-based model fits very well the data in all cases. A comparison is made between excited- and ground-state isomerizations. The influence of structural properties of the dyes on the photophysical parameters is also discussed.},

In many cases, the dyes act as fluorescent labels for biomolecules, and can interact with the biomolecule either through covalent or noncovalent bonding. One particularly important application involves dyes that bind to double helical DNA by intercalation and exhibit large fluorescence enhancements upon binding. This chapter describes recent investigations of the noncovalent binding modes by which cyanine dyes recognize DNA, with special emphasis placed on relationships between the dye structure and DNA binding mode. In addition to simple binding of the dye as a monomer, several dyes form well-defined helical aggregates using DNA as a template. While these dyes are typically achiral, the aggregates exhibit induced chirality due to the right-handed helical structure of the underlying DNA template. Spectroscopic methods for characterizing these supramolecular assemblies as well as the monomeric complexes are described.},

Benchmark comparisons find that the response time of the new method outperforms traditional methods of averaging. Our approach makes no assumption about the number or distribution of underlying FRET states. The new method also yields information about joint parameter distributions going beyond the standard framework of FRET analysis. For example, the running distribution of FRET means contains more information than any conceivable single measure of FRET efficiency. The method is tested against simulated data and then applied to a pilot-study sample of calmodulin molecules immobilized in lipid vesicles, revealing evidence for multiple dynamical states.},

   Abstract = {Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a powerful optical technique to determine intra-molecular distances. However, the dye rotational motion and the linker flexibility complicate the relationship between the measured energy transfer efficiency and the distance between the anchoring points of the dyes. In this study, we present a simple model that describes the linker and dye dynamics as diffusion on a sphere. Single-pair energy transfer was treated in the weak excitation limit, photon statistics and scaffold flexibility were ignored, and different time-averaging regimes were considered. Despite the approximations, our model provides new insights for experimental designs and results interpretation in single-molecule FRET. Monte Carlo simulations produced distributions of the inter-dye distance, the dipole orientation factor, kappa(2), and the transfer efficiency, E, which were in perfect agreement with independently derived theoretical functions. Contrary to common perceptions, our data show that longer linkers will actually restrict the motion of dye dipoles and hence worsen the isotropic 23 approximation of kappa(2). It is also found that the thermal motions of the dye-linker system cause fast and large efficiency fluctuations, as shown by the simulated FRET time-trajectories binned on a microsecond time scale. A fundamental resolution limit of single-molecule FRET measurements emerges around 1-10 mus, which should be considered for the interpretation of data recorded on such fast time scales.},

   Abstract = {The conformational states of Escherichia coli Rep helicase undergoing ATP hydrolysis while bound to a partial-duplex DNA (pdDNA) were studied using single-molecule FRET. Crystallographic studies showed that Rep bound to single-stranded DNA can exist in open and closed conformations that differ in the orientation of the 2B subdomain. FRET measurements between eight Rep mutants donor-labeled at different residues and pdDNA acceptor-labeled at the junction were conducted at each of the four nucleotide states. The positions of donor-labeled residues, based on crystal structure, and FRET measurements between these donor molecules and the acceptor fluorophore at the DNA junction were used to predict the most likely position for the DNA junction using a triangulation algorithm. These predicted junction positions are compared with the crystal structure to determine whether the open or closed conformation is more consistent with the FRET data. Our data revealed that there are two distinct Rep-pdDNA conformations in the ATPgammaS and ADP states, an unexpected finding. The primary conformation is similar to that observed in nucleotide-free and ADP.Pi states, and the secondary conformation is a novel conformation where the duplex DNA and 2B subdomain moved as a unit by 13 A relative to the rest of the protein. The primary conformation found in all nucleotide states is consistent with the closed conformation of the crystal structure however; the secondary conformation is a new conformation that has not been observed before. We discuss the possible implications of this newly observed conformation.},

   Abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a technique used to measure the interaction between two molecules labeled with two different fluorophores (the donor and the acceptor) by the transfer of energy from the excited donor to the acceptor. In biological applications, this technique has become popular to qualitatively map protein-protein interactions, and in biophysical projects it is used as a quantitative measure for distances between a single donor and acceptor molecule. Numerous approaches can be found in the literature to quantify and map FRET, but the measures they provide are often difficult to interpret. We propose here a quantitative comparison of these methods by using a surface FRET system with controlled amounts of donor and acceptor fluorophores and controlled distances between them. We support the system with a Monte Carlo simulation of FRET, which provides reference values for the FRET efficiency under various experimental conditions. We validate a representative set of FRET efficiencies and indices calculated from the different methods with different experimental settings. Finally, we test their sensitivity and draw conclusions for the preparation of FRET experiments in more complex and less-controlled systems.},

   Abstract = {Polyproline has recently been used as a spacer between donor and acceptor chromophores to help establish the accuracy of distances determined from single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. This work showed that the FRET efficiency in water is higher than expected for a rigid spacer and was attributed to the flexibility of the polypeptide. Here, we investigate this issue further, using a combination of single-molecule fluorescence intensity and lifetime measurements, NMR, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations of polyproline-20 that include the dyes and their linkers to the polypeptide. NMR shows that in water approximately 30% of the molecules contain internal cis prolines, whereas none are detectable in trifluoroethanol. Simulations suggest that the all-trans form of polyproline is relatively stiff, with persistence lengths of 9-13 nm using different established force fields, and that the kinks arising from internal cis prolines are primarily responsible for the higher mean FRET efficiency in water. We show that the observed efficiency histograms and distributions of donor fluorescence lifetimes are explained by the presence of multiple species with efficiencies consistent with the simulations and populations determined by NMR. In calculating FRET efficiencies from the simulation, we find that the fluctuations of the chromophores, attached to long flexible linkers, also play an important role. A similar simulation approach suggests that the flexibility of the chromophore linkers is largely responsible for the previously unexplained high value of R(0) required to fit the data in the classic study of Stryer and Haugland.},

The obtained results indicate that the efficiency of FRET can be significantly enhanced at a given distance if the energy transfer takes place toward multiple acceptors that are closely located on a macromolecule instead of a single acceptor molecule as it is currently used in FRET analysis. On the other hand, reasonable FRET efficiency can be obtained at significantly longer distances than in the case of a single acceptor. Randomly distributed and parallel orientated acceptor transition moments with respect to the transition moment of the donor molecule have been analyzed as two extreme cases. As expected, a parallel orientation of donor and acceptor transition moments results in a more efficient excitation energy transfer.

The pair consists of tC(O), 1,3-diaza-2-oxophenoxazine, as an energy donor and the newly developed tC(nitro), 7-nitro-1,3-diaza-2-oxophenothiazine, as an energy acceptor. The FRET-pair successfully monitors distances covering up to more than one turn of the DNA duplex. Importantly, we show that the rigid stacking of the two base analogs, and consequently excellent control of their exact positions and orientations, results in a high control of the orientation factor and hence very distinct FRET changes as the number of bases separating tC(O) and tC(nitro) is varied. A set of DNA strands containing the FRET-pair at wisely chosen locations will, thus, make it possible to accurately distinguish distance- from orientation-changes using FRET. In combination with the good nucleobase analog properties, this points toward detailed studies of the inherent dynamics of nucleic acid structures. Moreover, the placement of FRET-pair chromophores inside the base stack will be a great advantage in studies where other (biomacro)molecules interact with the nucleic acid. Lastly, our study gives possibly the first truly solid experimental support to the dependence of energy transfer efficiency on orientation of involved transition dipoles as predicted by the Forster theory.},

   Abstract = {In this work we examine the trapping and conversion of visible light energy into chemical energy using a supramolecular assembly. The assembly consists of a light-absorbing antenna and a porphyrin redox center, which are covalently attached to two complementary 14-mer DNA strands, hybridized to form a double helix and anchored to a lipid membrane. The excitation energy is finally trapped in the lipid phase of the membrane as a benzoquinone radical anion that could potentially be used in subsequent chemical reactions. In addition, in this model complex, the hydrophobic porphyrin moiety acts as an anchor into the liposome positioning the DNA construct on the lipid membrane surface. The results show the suitability of our system as a prototype for DNA-based light-harvesting devices, in which energy transfer from the aqueous phase to the interior of the lipid membrane is followed by charge separation.},

   Abstract = {Time series data provided by single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments offer the opportunity to infer not only model parameters describing molecular complexes, e.g., rate constants, but also information about the model itself, e.g., the number of conformational states. Resolving whether such states exist or how many of them exist requires a careful approach to the problem of model selection, here meaning discrimination among models with differing numbers of states. The most straightforward approach to model selection generalizes the common idea of maximum likelihood--selecting the most likely parameter values--to maximum evidence: selecting the most likely model. In either case, such an inference presents a tremendous computational challenge, which we here address by exploiting an approximation technique termed variational Bayesian expectation maximization. We demonstrate how this technique can be applied to temporal data such as smFRET time series; show superior statistical consistency relative to the maximum likelihood approach; compare its performance on smFRET data generated from experiments on the ribosome; and illustrate how model selection in such probabilistic or generative modeling can facilitate analysis of closely related temporal data currently prevalent in biophysics.

When combined with a known structure of the macromolecule(s) to which the fluorophores are attached, a three-dimensional model of the system can be determined. However, care has to be taken to properly derive distance from fluorescence energy transfer efficiency and to recognize the systematic or random errors for this relationship.

The thorough characterization of this class of dyes will facilitate selection of the appropriate red-absorbing fluorescent labels for applications in fluorescence assays. The influences of polarity, viscosity, and the addition of detergent (Tween20) on the spectroscopic properties were investigated, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was utilized to assess the photophysical properties of the dyes under high excitation conditions. The dyes can be classified into groups based on the results presented. For example, while the fluorescence quantum yield of ATTO655, ATTO680, and EVOblue30 is primarily controlled by the polarity of the surrounding medium, more hydrophobic and structurally flexible dyes of the DY-family are strongly influenced by the viscosity of the medium and the addition of detergents. Covalent binding of the dyes to biotin and subsequent addition of streptavidin results in reversible fluorescence quenching or changes in the relaxation time of other photophysical processes of some dyes, most likely due to interactions with tryptophan residues in the streptavin binding site.},

Six sets of internitroxide distances, ranging from 20 to 50 A, were measured on an RNA duplex with a known X-ray crystal structure. The measured distances strongly correlate (R(2) = 0.97) with those predicted using an efficient algorithm for determining the expected internitroxide distances from the parent RNA structure.

Analysis of electron spin dipolar interactions between pairs of nitroxides yields the inter-nitroxide distance, which provides quantitative structural information. The development of pulse EPR methods has enabled such distance measurements up to 70 A in bio-molecules, thus opening up the possibility of SDSL global structural mapping. This study evaluates SDSL distance measurement using a nitroxide (designated as R5) that can be attached, in an efficient and cost-effective manner, to a phosphorothioate backbone position at arbitrary DNA or RNA sequences. R5 pairs were attached to selected positions of a dodecamer DNA duplex with a known NMR structure, and eight distances, ranging from 20 to 40 A, were measured using double electron-electron resonance (DEER). The measured distances correlated strongly (R2 = 0.98) with the predicted values calculated based on a search of sterically allowable R5 conformations in the NMR structure, thus demonstrating accurate distance measurements using R5. Furthermore, distance measurement in a 42 kD DNA was demonstrated. The results establish R5 as a sequence-independent probe for global structural mapping of DNA and DNA-protein complexes.},

The quantum yield of fluorescence at 297 K is Phi(f) = 0.02-0.07 and increases substantially with decreasing temperature, the smallest change occurring for A-4, where intersystem crossing and internal conversion at the trans side are largest. Photobleaching contains two parts one from trans --> cis photoisomerization and another from the T-T transition in the range of ground state absorption. Population and decay of the triplet state were observed in the presence and absence of sensitizers, the lifetime at room temperature being in the millisecond range. For the cyclic bis-cyanines A-4 and A-5, where trans --> cis photoisomerization is hindered, the quantum yield of intersystem crossing approaches Phi(isc) approximate to 0.1 and 0.03, respectively, and Phi(isc) is even smaller for the other dyes. The quantum yield of trans --> cis photoisomerization is substantial for the monomers; for example, Phi(t-->c) = 0.25 for B-1 at 297 K and drops with decreasing temperature. The smaller values for the single-chain bis-cyanines, e.g., Phi(t-->c) = 0.05 for A-2, are due to the reduced flexibility. The activation parameters for the thermal back-reaction are analyzed. The characteristic features of structure influencing the mechanism, i.e., the photochemical deactivation pathways of the excited trans isomers, are discussed.},

   Abstract = {The four-way DNA (Holliday) junction is an important postulated intermediate in the process of genetic recombination. Earlier studies have suggested that the junction exists in two alternative conformations, depending upon the salt concentration present. At high salt concentrations the junction folds into a stacked X structure, while at low salt concentrations the data indicate an extended unstacked conformation. The stereochemical conformation of the four-way DNA junction at low salt (low alkali ion concentration and no alkaline earth ions) was established by comparing the efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between donor and acceptor molecules attached pairwise in three permutations to the 5' termini of the duplex arms. A new variation of FRET was implemented based upon a systematic variation of the fraction of donor labeled single strands. The FRET results indicate that the structure of the four-way DNA junction at low salt exists as an unstacked, extended, square arrangement of the four duplex arms. The donor titration measurements made in the presence of magnesium ions clearly show the folding of the junction into the X stacked structure. In addition, the FRET efficiency can be measured. The fluorescence anisotropy of the acceptor in the presence of Mg2+ during donor titrations was also measured; the FRET efficiency can be calculated from the anisotropy data and the results are consistent with the folded, stacked X structure.},

   Abstract = {We have carried out fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements on four-way DNA junctions in order to analyze the global structure and its dependence on the concentration of several types of ions. A knowledge of the structure and its sensitivity to the solution environment is important for a full understanding of recombination events in DNA. The stereochemical arrangement of the four DNA helices that make up the four-way junction was established by a global comparison of the efficiency of FRET between donor and acceptor molecules attached pairwise in all possible permutations to the 5' termini of the duplex arms of the four-way structure. The conclusions are based upon a comparison between a series of many identical DNA molecules which have been labeled on different positions, rather than a determination of a few absolute distances. Details of the FRET analysis are presented; features of the analysis with particular relevance to DNA structures are emphasized. Three methods were employed to determine the efficiency of FRET: (1) enhancement of the acceptor fluorescence, (2) decrease of the donor quantum yield, and (3) shortening of the donor fluorescence lifetime. The FRET results indicate that the arms of the four-way junction are arranged in an antiparallel stacked X-structure when salt is added to the solution. The ion-related conformational change upon addition of salt to a solution originally at low ionic strength progresses in a continuous noncooperative manner as the ionic strength of the solution increases. The mode of ion interaction at the strand exchange site of the junction is discussed.},

The experimental data were consistent with a 1/[1 + (R/R0)6] dependence of FRET efficiency characteristic for the Forster dipole-dipole mechanism. The thermal dissociation of the strands of the duplex DNA species can be followed by using FRET, and from these data we have been able to obtain enthalpies of duplex formation in good agreement with earlier measurements using alternative techniques.

The required oxidant for this unifying mechanism based on a reducing and oxidizing system (ROXS) is formed via (photo-) reaction with molecular oxygen. We present evidence that this oxidized form is a quinone derivative of Trolox with strong oxidizing properties. These findings shed light on many contradicting results regarding the action of antifading agents and might lead to a common mechanistic understanding of photobleaching and its prevention. Finally, a recipe on the proper use of Trolox as an antifading agent is provided.},

   Abstract = {The measurement of the efficiency of Forster long-range resonance energy transfer between donor (D) and acceptor (A) luminophores attached to the same macromolecular substrate can be used to estimate the D-A separation, R. If the D and A transition dipoles sample all orientations with respect to the substrate (the isotropic condition) in a time short compared with the transfer time (the dynamic averaging condition), the average orientation factor less than K2 greater than is 2/3. If the isotropic condition is not satisfied but the dynamic averaging condition is, upper and lower bounds for less than K2 greater than, and thus R, may be obtained from observed D and A depolarizations, and these limits may be further narrowed if the transfer depolarization is also known. This paper offers experimental protocols for obtaining this reorientational information and presents contour plots of less than K2 greater than min and less than K2 greater than max as functions of generally observable depolarizations. This permits an uncertainty to be assigned to the determined value of R. The details of the D and A reoreintational process need not be known, but the orientational distributions are assumed to have at least approximate axial symmetry with respect to a stationary substrate. Average depolarization factors are derived for various orientational distribution functions that demonstrate the effects of various mechanisms for reorientation of the luminophores. It is shown that in general the static averaging regime does not lend itself to determinations of R.},

These spectroscopic properties depend strongly on the local dye environment. Fluorescein was studied: (1) attached to biotin (BF), (2) BF bound to avidin; and attached to two positions in DNA. X-rhodamine and tetramethyl-rhodamine were studied as free dyes and attached at the 5'-end of DNA. We propose a general method to determine the molar absorptivity and tau0 of a dye attached to DNA based on the reaction of a biotinylated and dye-labeled oligomer with standardized avidin. The molar absorptivity of a second dye attached to a DNA duplex can be obtained by comparing spectra of doubly and singly labeled sequences. S, arising from dye-DNA interactions can then be determined. R0 for free and attached dyes showed differences from 1.1 to 4.2 A. We present evidence for the direct interaction of dyes attached to the termini of various single-stranded DNA sequences.},

The photochemical mechanism by which switching occurs has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we have determined the mechanism of photoswitching by characterizing the kinetics of dark state formation and the spectral and structural properties of the dark state. The rate of switching to the dark state depends on the concentration of the primary thiol in the solution and the solution pH in a manner quantitatively consistent with the formation of an encounter complex between the cyanine dye and ionized thiol prior to their conjugation. Mass spectrometry suggests that the photoconversion product is a thiol-cyanine adduct in which covalent attachment of the thiol to the polymethine bridge disrupts the original conjugated pi-electron system of the dye.},

By using DNA as a rigid spacer, a series of constructs with varying intramolecular donor-acceptor spacings were used to measure the mean and distribution width of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiencies as a function of distance. The mean single-pair FRET efficiencies qualitatively follow the distance dependence predicted by Forster theory. Possible contributions to the widths of the FRET efficiency distributions are discussed, and potential applications in the study of biopolymer conformational dynamics are suggested. The ability to measure intramolecular (and intermolecular) distances for single molecules implies the ability to distinguish and monitor subpopulations of molecules in a mixture with different distances or conformational states. This is demonstrated by monitoring substrate and product subpopulations before and after a restriction endonuclease cleavage reaction. Distance measurements at single-molecule resolution also should facilitate the study of complex reactions such as biopolymer folding. To this end, the denaturation of a DNA hairpin was examined by using single-pair FRET.},

   Abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is commonly used to determine the proximity of fluorophores, but usually many assumptions are required to gain a quantitative relationship between the likelihood of energy transfer and fluorophore separation. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations provide one way of checking these assumptions, but before using simulations to study complex systems it is important to make sure that they can correctly model the motions of fluorophores and the likely FRET efficiency in a simple system. Here we simulate a well characterised situation of independent fluorophores in solution so that we can compare the predictions with expected values. Our simulations reproduce the experimental fluorescence anisotropy of Alexafluor488 and predict that of AlexaFluor568. At the ensemble level we are able to reproduce the expected isotropic and dynamic motion of the fluorophores as well as the FRET efficiency of the system. At the level of single donor-acceptor pairs, however, very long simulations are required to adequately sample the translational motion of the fluorophores and more surprisingly also the rotational motion. Our studies demonstrate how MD simulations can be used in more complex systems to check if the dynamic orientation averaging regime applies, if the fluorophores have isotropic orientational motion, to calculate the likely values of the orientation factor kappa(2) and to determine the FRET efficiency of the system in both dynamic and static orientational averaging regimes. We also show that it is possible in some situations to create system specific relationships between FRET efficiency and fluorophore separation that can be used to interpret experimental data and find any correlations between kappa(2) and separation that may influence distance measurements.},

   Abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be utilized to gain low-resolution structural information by reporting on the proximity of molecules or measuring inter- and intramolecular distances. This method exploits the fact that the probability of the energy transfer is related to the separation between the fluorescent molecules. This relationship is well described for a single pair of fluorophores but is complicated in systems containing more than two fluorophores. Here, we present a Monte Carlo calculation scheme that has been implemented through a user-friendly web-based program called ExiFRET that can be used to determine the FRET efficiency in a wide range of fluorophore arrangements. ExiFRET is useful to model FRET for individual fluorophores randomly distributed in two or three dimensions, fluorophores linked in pairs or arranged in regular geometries with or without predefined stoichiometries. ExiFRET can model both uniform distributions and fluorophores that are aggregated in clusters. We demonstrate how this tool can be employed to understand the effect of labeling efficiency on FRET efficiency, estimate relative contributions of inter- and intramolecular FRET, investigate the structure of multimeric proteins, stoichiometries, and oligomers, and to aid experiments studying the aggregation of lipids and proteins in membrane environments. We also present an extension that can be used to study instances in which fluorophores have constrained orientations.},

The most probable joint distribution can be marginalized to obtain both the overall distribution of fluorescence photons and the apparent FRET efficiency distribution.

   Abstract = {We study the effect of dye-dye interactions in labeled double-stranded DNA molecules on the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency at the single-molecule level. An extensive analysis of internally labeled double-stranded DNA molecules in bulk and at the single-molecule level reveals that donor-acceptor absolute distances can be reliably extracted down to approximately 3-nm separation, provided that dye-dye quenching is accounted for. At these short separations, we find significant long-lived fluorescence fluctuations among discrete levels originating from the simultaneous and synchronous quenching of both dyes. By comparing four different donor-acceptor dye pairs (TMR-ATTO647N, Cy3-ATTO647N, TMR-Cy5, and Cy3-Cy5), we find that this phenomenon depends on the nature of the dye pair used, with the cyanine pair Cy3-Cy5 showing the least amount of fluctuations. The significance of these results is twofold: First, they illustrate that when dye-dye quenching is accounted for, single-molecule FRET can be used to accurately measure inter-dye distances, even at short separations. Second, these results are useful when deciding which dye pairs to use for nucleic acids analyses using FRET.},

   Abstract = {We studied the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency of different donor-acceptor labeled model DNA systems in aqueous solution from ensemble measurements and at the single molecule level. The donor dyes: tetramethylrhodamine (TMR); rhodamine 6G (R6G); and a carbocyanine dye (Cy3) were covalently attached to the 5'-end of a 40-mer model oligonucleotide. The acceptor dyes, a carbocyanine dye (Cy5), and a rhodamine derivative (JA133) were attached at modified thymidine bases in the complementary DNA strand with donor-acceptor distances of 5, 15, 25 and 35 DNA-bases, respectively. Anisotropy measurements demonstrate that none of the dyes can be observed as a free rotor; especially in the 5-bp constructs the dyes exhibit relatively high anisotropy values. Nevertheless, the dyes change their conformation with respect to the oligonucleotide on a slower time scale in the millisecond range. This results in a dynamic inhomogeneous distribution of donor/acceptor (D/A) distances and orientations. FRET efficiencies have been calculated from donor and acceptor fluorescence intensity as well as from time-resolved fluorescence measurements of the donor fluorescence decay. Dependent on the D/A pair and distance, additional strong fluorescence quenching of the donor is observed, which simulates lower FRET efficiencies at short distances and higher efficiencies at longer distances. On the other hand, spFRET measurements revealed subpopulations that exhibit the expected FRET efficiency, even at short D/A distances. In addition, the measured acceptor fluorescence intensities and lifetimes also partly show fluorescence quenching effects independent of the excitation wavelength, i.e. either directly excited or via FRET. These effects strongly depend on the D/A distance and the dyes used, respectively. The obtained data demonstrate that besides dimerization at short D/A distances, an electron transfer process between the acceptor Cy5 and rhodamine donors has to be taken into account. To explain deviations from FRET theory even at larger D/A distances, we suggest that the pi-stack of the DNA double helix mediates electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor, even over distances as long as 35 base pairs. Our data show that FRET experiments at the single molecule level are rather suited to resolve fluorescent subpopulations in heterogeneous mixture, information about strongly quenched subpopulations gets lost.},

Our results help to suggest that these assumptions need to be carefully considered when designing experiments. We show that at short donor-acceptor separation, dipole-dipole approximation breaks down and Forster theory fails and cannot be used to obtain correct distances. We also explicitly demonstrate that dyes' linkers allow for a lot of flexibility in the fluorescent label orientation and position resulting in distances much shorter than assumed earlier.},

We measured the fluorescence lifetimes of individual tetramethylrhodamine molecules, linked to an 18-mer deoxyribonucleotide sequence specific for M13 DNA, by time-resolved, single-photon counting in a confocal fluorescence microscope during Brownian motion in solution. When many molecules were observed, a biexponential fluorescence decay was observed with equal amplitudes. However, on the single-molecule level, the fraction of one of the amplitudes spanned from 0 to unity for a collection of single-molecule detections. Further analysis by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy made on many molecules revealed a process that obeys a stretched exponential relaxation law. These facts, combined with previous evidence of the quenching effect of guanosine on rhodamines, indicate that the tetramethylrhodamine molecule senses conformational transitions as it associates and dissociates to a guanosine-rich area. Thus, our results reveal conformational transitions in a single molecule in solution under conditions that are relevant for biological processes.},

   Abstract = {A general strategy to identify and quantify sample molecules in dilute solution employing a new spectroscopic method for data registration and specific burst analysis denoted as multi-parameter fluorescence detection (MFD) was recently developed. While keeping the experimental advantage of monitoring single molecules diffusing through the microscopic open volume element of a confocal epi-illuminated set-up as in experiments of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, MFD uses pulsed excitation and time-correlated single-photon counting to simultaneously monitor the evolution of the four-dimensional fluorescence information (intensity, F; lifetime, tau; anisotropy, r; and spectral range, lambda(r)) in real time and allows for exclusion of extraneous events for subsequent analysis. In this review, the versatility of this technique in confocal fluorescence spectroscopy will be presented by identifying freely diffusing single dyes via their characteristic fluorescence properties in homogenous assays, resulting in significantly reduced misclassification probabilities. Major improvements in background suppression are demonstrated by time-gated autocorrelation analysis of fluorescence intensity traces extracted from MFD data. Finally, applications of MFD to real-time conformational dynamics studies of fluorescence labeled oligonucleotides will be presented.},

   Abstract = {Dye photobleaching is a major constraint of fluorescence readout within a range of applications. In this study, we investigated the influence of photobleaching in fluorescence experiments applying multicolor laser as well as Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mediated excitation using several red-emitting dyes frequently used in multicolor experiments or as FRET acceptors. The chosen dyes (cyanine 5 (Cy5), MR121, Alexa660, Alexa680, Atto647N, Atto655) have chemically distinct chromophore systems and can be excited at 650 nm. Several fluorescence analysis techniques have been applied to detect photobleaching and to disclose the underlying photophysics, all of which are based on single-molecule detection: (1) fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) of bulk solutions, (2) fluorescence cross-correlation of single-molecule trajectories, and (3) multiparameter fluorescence detection (MFD) of single-molecule events. The maximum achievable fluorescence signals as well as the survival times of the red dyes were markedly reduced under additional laser irradiation in the range of 500 nm. Particularly at excitation levels at or close to saturation, the 500 nm irradiation effectively induced transitions to higher excited electronic states on already excited dye molecules, leading to a pronounced bleaching reactivity. A theoretical model for the observed laser irradiance dependence of the fluorescence brightness of a Cy5 FRET acceptor dye has been developed introducing the full description of the underlying photophysics. The model takes into account acceptor as well as donor photobleaching from higher excited electronic states, population of triplet states, and energy transfer to both the ground and excited states of the acceptor dye. Also, photoinduced reverse intersystem crossing via higher excited triplet states is included, which was found to be very efficient for Cy5 attached to DNA. Comparing continuous wave (cw) and pulsed donor excitation, a strong enhancement of acceptor photobleaching by a factor of 5 was observed for the latter. Thus, in the case of fluorescence experiments utilizing multicolor pulsed laser excitation, the application of the appropriate timing of synchronized green and red laser pulses in an alternating excitation mode can circumvent excessive photobleaching. Moreover, important new single-molecule analysis diagnosis tools are presented: (1) For the case of excessive acceptor photobleaching, cross-correlation analysis of single-molecule trajectories of the fluorescence signal detected in the donor and acceptor detection channels and vice versa shows an anticorrelated exponential decay and growth, respectively. (2) The time difference, Tg - Tr, of the mean observation times of all photons detected for the donor and acceptor detection channels within a single-molecule fluorescence burst allows one to identify and exclude molecules with an event of acceptor photobleaching. The presented single-molecule analysis methods can be constrained to, for example, FRET-active subpopulations, reducing bias from FRET-inactive molecules. The observations made are of strong relevance for and demand a careful choice of laser action in multicolor and FRET experiments, in particular when performed at or close to saturation.},

   Abstract = {Conformational distributions of a four-way DNA junction have been examined by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). A series of dye-labeled junctions were synthesized with donor (fluorescein) and acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine) dyes conjugated to the 5' termini of the duplex arms in all six pairwise combinations. The fluorescence decay of the donor in each junction was measured by time-correlated single-photon counting. The distributions of donor-acceptor (D-A) distances present between each pair of arms were recovered from the donor decays using a continuous Gaussian distribution model. The overall geometry of the four-way junction defined by the six mean D-A distances was consistent with a stacked-X structure, wherein pairs of duplex arms associate to form two continuous domains. Large differences were observed in the widths of the D-A distance distributions, depending on which pair of arms were labeled with the donor and acceptor dyes. Distances measured along the stacking domains were characterized by relatively narrow distributions, indicating that these domains were rigid, whereas distances between stacking domains had broader distributions, reflecting variability in the angle between the two domains. The distances described by broad distributions were overestimated by steady-state FRET measurements. These results suggest that an ensemble of stacked-X structures are present in solution, characterized by differences in the small angle between the stacking domains. Temperature and solvent effects on the recovered distribution widths provide an indication of flexibility in the four-way junction.},

   Abstract = {The influence of the highly fluorescent tricyclic cytosine base analogue (tC) on duplex DNA conformation is investigated. The duplex properties are characterized by absorbance and circular dichroism (CD) for all combinations of neighbouring bases to tC, and an NMR structure is determined for one tC-containing sequence. For the oligonucleotides with one tC incorporated instead of cytosine, the melting temperature is increased on average by 2.7 degrees C above that for the unmodified ones. CD spectra are practically identical for modified and unmodified sequences, indicating an unperturbed B-DNA conformation. The NMR structure determination of the self-complementary sequence 5'-CTC(tC)ACGTGGAG shows a DNA conformation consistent with B-form for the whole duplex. The root-mean-square distance for the nucleotides of the eight central base pairs between the 10 structures with lowest CYANA target functions and a mean structure is 0.45 +/- 0.17 A. The NMR data confirm correct base pairing for tC by the observation of both intrastrand and interstrand imino proton NOEs. Altogether, this suggests that tC works well as a cytosine analogue, i.e. it is situated in the base stack, forming hydrogen bonds with G in the complementary strand, without distorting the DNA backbone conformation. This first example of an artificial, highly fluorescent DNA base that does not perturb the DNA conformation could have valuable applications for the study of the structure and dynamics of nucleic acid systems.},

   Pages = {15319-29},
   Abstract = {Tetraphenyl porphyrin substituted deoxyuridine was used as a building block to create discrete multiporphyrin arrays via site specific incorporation into DNA. The successful covalent attachment of up to 11 tetraphenyl porphyrins in a row onto DNA shows that there is virtually no limitation in the amount of substituents, and the porphyrin arrays thus obtained reach the nanometer scale (approximately 10 nm). The porphyrin substituents are located in the major groove of the dsDNA and destabilize the duplex by deltaT(m) 5-7 degrees C per porphyrin modification. Force-field structure minimization shows that the porphyrins are either in-line with the groove in isolated modifications or aligned parallel to the nucleobases in adjacent modifications. The CD signals of the porphyrins are dominated by a negative peak arising from the intrinsic properties of the building block. In the single strands, the porphyrins induce stabilization of a secondary helical structure which is confined to the porphyrin modified part. This arrangement can be reproduced by force-field minimization and reveals an elongated helical arrangement compared to the double helix of the porphyrin-DNA. This secondary structure is disrupted above approximately 55 degrees C (T(p)) which is shown by various melting experiments. Both absorption and emission spectroscopy disclose electronic interactions between the porphyrin units upon stacking along the outer rim of the DNA leading to a broadening of the absorbance and a quenching of the emission. The single-stranded and double-stranded form show different spectroscopic properties due to the different arrangement of the porphyrins. Above T(p) the electronic properties (absorption and emission) of the porphyrins change compared to room temperature measurements due to the disruption of the porphyrin stacking at high temperature. The covalent attachment of porphyrins to DNA is therefore a suitable way of creating helical stacks of porphyrins on the nanometer scale.},

   Abstract = {A series of short RNA duplexes containing one or two 1-ethynylpyrene-modified adenine bases was synthesised. The melting behaviour of these duplexes was examined by monitoring temperature-dependent pyrene fluorescence. In the singly modified RNA duplexes, the bases flanking the ethynylpyrene-rA were varied to examine the sequence specificity of the fluorescence change of pyrene upon RNA hybridisation. Because an increase in pyrene fluorescence upon melting of the duplex can be correlated with intercalation of pyrene, and a decrease is usually associated with the position of pyrene outside the strand, a relationship between the flanking bases and the tendency of the dye to intercalate has been established. It was found that pyrene intercalation is less likely to take place if the modified base is flanked only by A-U base pairs. Flanking G-C base pairs, even only in the 5'-direction of the modified base, will favour intercalation. In addition, we examined a doubly modified compound that had a pyrene located on each strand. The spectra indicated that the two pyrenes were close enough for interaction. Upon melting of the strand, a fluorescence blue shift corresponding to the dissociation of the pyrene-pyrene complex could be observed in addition to the intensity effect already known from the singly modified compounds. Two melting curves based on the different properties of the fluorophore could be extracted, leading to different melting points corresponding to the global duplex melting and to the change of local pyrene environment, respectively.},

   Abstract = {The nucleosome has a central role in the compaction of genomic DNA and the control of DNA accessibility for transcription and replication. To help understanding the mechanism of nucleosome opening and closing in these processes, we studied the disassembly of mononucleosomes by quantitative single-molecule FRET with high spatial resolution, using the SELEX-generated "Widom 601" positioning sequence labeled with donor and acceptor fluorophores. Reversible dissociation was induced by increasing NaCl concentration. At least 3 species with different FRET were identified and assigned to structures: (i) the most stable high-FRET species corresponding to the intact nucleosome, (ii) a less stable mid-FRET species that we attribute to a first intermediate with a partially unwrapped DNA and less histones, and (iii) a low-FRET species characterized by a very broad FRET distribution, representing highly unwrapped structures and free DNA formed at the expense of the other 2 species. Selective FCS analysis indicates that even in the low-FRET state, some histones are still bound to the DNA. The interdye distance of 54.0 A measured for the high-FRET species corresponds to a compact conformation close to the known crystallographic structure. The coexistence and interconversion of these species is first demonstrated under non-invasive conditions. A geometric model of the DNA unwinding predicts the presence of the observed FRET species. The different structures of these species in the disassembly pathway map the energy landscape indicating major barriers for 10-bp and minor ones for 5-bp DNA unwinding steps.},

   Abstract = {Molecular photonics is a new emerging field of research around the premise that it is possible to develop optical devices using single molecules as building blocks. Truly technological impact in the field requires focussed efforts on designing functional molecular devices as well as having access to their photonic properties on an individual basis. In this Minireview we discuss our approach towards the design and single-molecule investigation of one-dimensional multimolecular arrays intended to work as molecular photonic wires. Three different schemes have been explored: a) perylene-based dimer and trimer arrays displaying coherent exciton delocalisation at room temperature; b) DNA-based unidirectional molecular wires containing up to five different chromophores and exhibiting weak excitonic interactions between neighbouring dyes; and c) one-dimensional multichromophoric polymers based on perylene polyisocyanides showing excimerlike emission. As a whole, our single-molecule data show the importance of well-defined close packing of chromophores for obtaining optimal excitonic behaviour at room temperature. Further improvement on (bio)chemical synthesis, together with the use of single-molecule techniques, should lead in the near future to efficient and reliable photonic wires with true device functionality.},

The extent of energy transfer within each series increases as the number of bulged nucleotides varies from 1 to 7, indicating a shortening of the end-to-end distance. This is consistent with a bending of DNA and RNA helices that is greater for larger bulges. The FRET efficiency for DNA molecules with A9 bulges is lower than the efficiency for the corresponding A7 bulged molecules, although the A9 molecules exhibit increased electrophoretic retardation. Ranges of bending angles can be estimated from the FRET results.},

Photon counts from both immobilized and freely diffusing molecules are considered. Our starting point is the joint distribution for the donor and acceptor photons for a system described by an arbitrary kinetic scheme. This is simplified by exploiting the time scale separation between fast fluorescent transitions and slow processes which include conformational dynamics, intersystem conversion to a dark state, and translational diffusion in and out of the laser spot. The fast fluorescent transitions result in a Poisson distribution of the number of photons which is then averaged over slow fluctuations of the local transfer efficiency and the total number of photons. The contribution of various processes to the distribution and the variance of the energy-transfer efficiency are analyzed.},

   Abstract = {Under relatively mild conditions, we show how one can extract information about conformational dynamics from Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments on diffusing molecules without modeling diffusion. Starting from a rigorous theory that does treat diffusion, we first examine when the single-molecule FRET efficiency distribution can be decomposed into the measured distribution of the total number of photons and the efficiency distribution of an immobilized molecule in the absence of shot noise. If the conformation does not change during the time the molecule spends in the laser spot, this is possible when (I) the efficiency is independent of the location in the laser spot and (II) the total number of photons does not depend on conformation. This decomposition is approximate when the conformation changes during the diffusion time. However, it does provide a simple framework for analyzing data. This is illustrated for a two-state system where the FRET efficiency distribution can be found analytically for all values of the interconversion rates. If the arrival time of each donor and acceptor photon can be monitored, we introduce an alternative procedure that allows one to rigorously extract the rates of conformational changes when the above two conditions hold. In this case, the pattern of colors in the photon trajectory depends solely on conformational dynamics. This can be exploited in the framework of statistical inference because the likelihood function, which must be optimized with respect to the model rate parameters, depends only on how the conformation changes during the interval between photons with specified colors.},

For a photon trajectory with measured interphoton times, the pattern of colors is decoded by maximizing the appropriate likelihood function. This approach can be used to analyze bursts of photons from diffusing molecules as well as photon trajectories generated by immobilized molecules. The procedure is illustrated using simulated photon trajectories corresponding to two-state and three-state molecules. The method works even when the photon colors appear to be scrambled because of high background noise, the photophysical properties of the conformers are similar, or the conformational and photon count rates are comparable. The consistency of the model with the data can be checked by recoloring the photon trajectories and comparing the predicted and observed FRET efficiency histograms.},

Due to this extraordinarily high K(SV), nanoparticle SET (NSET) detection limit can be as low as 300 fM concentration of RNA, depending on the size of gold nanoparticle. We have shown that the distance-dependent quenching efficiency is highly dependent on the particle size and the distance at which the energy-transfer efficiency is 50 %, ranges all the way from 8 nm, which is very close to the accessible distance of conventional Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), to about 40 nm by choosing gold nanoparticles of different diameters. Our result points out that dipole-to-metal-particle energy transfer and NSET models provide a better description of the distance dependence of the quenching efficiencies for 8 nm gold nanoparticle, but agreement is poor for 40 and 70 nm gold nanoparticles, for which the measured values were always larger than the predicted ones.},

   Abstract = {Cy3B is an extremely bright and stable fluorescent dye, which is only available for coupling to nucleic acids post-synthetically. This severely limits its use in the fields of genomics, biology and nanotechnology. We have optimized the synthesis of Cy3B, and for the first time produced a diverse range of Cy3B monomers for use in solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis. This molecular toolkit includes phosphoramidite monomers with Cy3B linked to deoxyribose, to the 5-position of thymine, and to a hexynyl linker, in addition to an oligonucleotide synthesis resin in which Cy3B is linked to deoxyribose. These monomers have been used to incorporate single and multiple Cy3B units into oligonucleotides internally and at both termini. Cy3B Taqman probes, Scorpions and HyBeacons have been synthesized and used successfully in mutation detection, and a dual Cy3B Molecular Beacon was synthesized and found to be superior to the corresponding Cy3B/DABCYL Beacon. Attachment of Cy3, Cy3B and Cy5 to the 5-position of thymidine by an ethynyl linker enabled the synthesis of an oligonucleotide FRET system. The rigid linker between the dye and nucleobase minimizes dye-dye and dye-DNA interactions and reduces fluorescence quenching. These reagents open up new future applications of Cy3B, including more sensitive single-molecule and cell-imaging studies.},

A hexagonal DNA nanoassembly is used as a scaffold to host both the input and output dyes. The use of DNA to host functional groups enables spatial resolution on the level of single base pairs, well below the wavelength of light. Communication between the input and output dyes is achieved through excitation energy transfer. Output selection is achieved by the addition of a mediator dye intercalating between the DNA base pairs transferring the excitation energy from input to output through energy hopping. This creates a tool for selective excitation energy transfer on the nanometer scale with spectral and spatial control. The ability to direct excitation energy in a controlled way on the nanometer scale is important for the incorporation of photochemical processes in nanotechnology.},

   Abstract = {DNA is a promising material for use in nanotechnology; the persistence length of double stranded DNA gives it a rigid structure in the several-nanometer regime, and its four letter alphabet enables addressability. We present the construction of a self-assembled DNA-based photonic wire capable of transporting excitation energy over a distance of more than 20 nm. The wire utilizes DNA as a scaffold for a chromophore with overlapping absorption and emission bands enabling fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between pairs of chromophores leading to sequential transfer of the excitation energy along the wire. This allows for the creation of a self-assembled photonic wire using straightforward construction and, in addition, allows for a large span in wire lengths without changing the basic components. The intercalating chromophore, YO, is chosen for its homotransfer capability enabling effective diffusive energy migration along the wire without loss in energy. In contrast to heterotransfer, i.e., multistep cascade FRET, where each step renders a photon with less energy than in the previous step, homotransfer preserves the energy in each step. By using injector and detector chromophores at opposite ends of the wire, directionality of the wire is achieved. The efficiency of the wire constructs is examined by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements and the energy transfer process is simulated using a Markov chain model. We show that it is possible to create two component DNA-based photonic wires capable of long-range energy transfer using a straightforward self-assembly approach.},

   Abstract = {The role of asymmetric charge neutralization as a primary determinant of protein-induced DNA helical bending remains controversial. Electrophoretic phasing experiments have been conducted previously for peptides derived from the yeast basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor GCN4 bound to AP-1 sites in duplex DNA. Mutations altering the electrostatic character of amino acids close to the DNA backbone result in phase-dependent gel mobility changes, interpreted as evidence of DNA bending. However, alternate interpretations are possible. The effect of electrostatic interactions on DNA conformation has now been investigated further, using purified peptides having indistinguishable AP-1 DNA affinity. Two independent techniques have been employed: electrophoretic phasing and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The phasing results imply DNA bending by bZIP charge variants, consistent with earlier findings. FRET studies yield the mean 5' end to 3' end distance of AP-1 DNA when free or bound to neutral or charged bZIP peptides. These distances were reduced in the charged variant complexes relative to those in the free duplex and the wild-type complex. Bending of the DNA helical axis is shown by molecular modeling to be the simplest interpretation of these results. The electrophoretic phasing and FRET results thus offer two mutually supportive lines of evidence for induced bending of the DNA helical axis due to asymmetric changes in charge density caused by the electrostatic character of the amino acids residing near the DNA backbone.},

Changes are more dramatic for the purines (dAMP, dGMP) than the pyrimidines(dCMP, dTMP), and for the nonsulfonated cyanine(DiIC2(3)) than the sulfonated dye (Cy3-SE).

DNA sequence determines the extent and nature of the interactions between the dye and the DNA bases, which are responsible for the unusual enhancement in fluorescence observed for a large number of oligonucleotides. Results are discussed in terms of a photoisomerization mechanism that deactivates the excited state and thus competes with fluorescence. The efficiency of isomerization decreases when Cy3-DNA interactions prevent rotation around the double bonds, resulting in an increase in the lifetime of the singlet excited state. We have shown that the ability of Cy3 to interact with DNA depends on the flexibility of the oligonucleotide and the presence of purines in the chain.},

   Abstract = {Molecular photonic wires are one-dimensional representatives of a family of nanoscale molecular devices that transport excited-state energy over considerable distances in analogy to optical waveguides in the far-field. In particular, the design and synthesis of such complex supramolecular devices is challenging concerning the desired homogeneity of energy transport. On the other hand, novel optical techniques are available that permit direct investigation of heterogeneity by studying one device at a time. In this article, we describe our efforts to synthesize and study DNA-based molecular photonic wires that carry several chromophores arranged in an energetic downhill cascade and exploit fluorescence resonance energy transfer to convey excited-state energy. The focus of this work is to understand and control the heterogeneity of such complex systems, applying single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy (SMFS) to dissect the different sources of heterogeneity, i.e., chemical heterogeneity and inhomogeneous broadening induced by the nanoenvironment. We demonstrate that the homogeneity of excited-state energy transport in DNA-based photonic wires is dramatically improved by immobilizing photonic wires in aqueous solution without perturbation by the surface. In addition, our study shows that the in situ construction of wire molecules, i.e., the stepwise hybridization of differently labeled oligonucleotides on glass cover slides, further decreases the observed heterogeneity in overall energy-transfer efficiency. The developed strategy enables efficient energy transfer between up to five chromophores in the majority of molecules investigated along a distance of approximately 14 nm. Finally, we used multiparameter SMFS to analyze the energy flow in photonic wires in more detail and to assign residual heterogeneity under optimized conditions in solution to different leakages and competing energy-transfer processes.},

   Abstract = {Inter- or intramolecular distances of biomolecules can be studied by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). For most FRET methods, the observable range of distances is limited to 1-10 nm, and the labeling efficiency has to be controlled carefully to obtain accurate distance determinations, especially for intensity-based methods. In this study, we exploit the triplet state of the acceptor fluorophore as a FRET readout using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and transient state monitoring. The influence of donor fluorescence leaking into the acceptor channel is minimized by a novel suppression algorithm for spectral bleed-through, thereby tolerating a high excess (up to 100-fold) of donor-only labeled samples. The suppression algorithm and the high sensitivity of the triplet state to small changes in the fluorophore excitation rate make it possible to extend the observable range of FRET efficiencies by up to 50% in the presence of large donor-only populations. Given this increased range of FRET efficiencies, its compatibility with organic fluorophores, and the low requirements on the labeling efficiency and instrumentation, we foresee that this approach will be attractive for in vitro and in vivo FRET-based spectroscopy and imaging.},

In this work we investigate the bending of a 30-base pair DNA fragment induced by Chironomus HMG1 (cHMG1a), and HMGI (cHMGI) proteins. The DNA bending was measured in solution by monitoring the end-to-end distance between fluorescence probes attached to opposite ends of the DNA fragment. The distance was measured by fluorescence energy transfer using a novel europium chelate as a fluorescence donor. These measurements revealed that the end-to-end distance in the 30-base pair DNA was decreased from approximately 100 A in free DNA to approximately 50.5 A in cHMG1a. DNA complex. The most probable DNA bending angle consistent with these distance measurements is about 150 degrees. The deletion of the charged regulatory domains located close to the C terminus of the HMG1 box domain of cHMG1a protein had no effect on the induced bend angle. The ability to induce a large DNA bend distinguishes the cHMG1 from the cHMGI protein. Only small perturbation of the DNA conformation was observed upon binding of the cHMGI protein. A strong DNA bending activity of cHMG1a and its relative abundance in the cell suggests that this protein plays a very important role in modulation of chromatin structure.},

   Abstract = {Lanthanide chelates used as donors offer several advantages over classical fluorescence probes in resonance energy transfer distance measurements. One of these advantages is that energy transfer can be conveniently measured using sensitized acceptor decay measurements. In these measurements a long microsecond lifetime of the lanthanide donor and a short nanosecond lifetime of the acceptor allow elimination of a signal from the unquenched donor. Therefore, the decay of sensitized acceptor emission reflects decay properties of the donor engaged in energy transfer. The purpose of this work is to point out the importance of the fact that the amplitude of the sensitized acceptor signal is dependent on the resonance energy transfer rate constant. Thus, in the case where there are two or more populations of donors with different energy transfer rate constants, the relative amplitudes of corresponding decay components observed in sensitized acceptor emission do not represent the relative populations of the donors. We use simulations to show that these effects can be very significant. A minor population of donors with a high rate of energy transfer can produce sensitized acceptor decay which is dominated by a decay component corresponding to this minor donor population. Using a simple experimental system of rapid diffusion limit energy transfer between a europium chelate and Cy5 acceptor we show that the predicted dependency of sensitized acceptor decay amplitude on the energy transfer rate is indeed observed. We suggest that the relative importance of decay components observed in sensitized acceptor emission should be evaluated after an appropriate correction of their values such that they properly reflect possible different populations of donors. We describe a method to perform such correction.},

Treating the head, body, and platform domains of the 30 S subunit as simple rigid bodies, the lowest-energy solution converges on a model that satisfies each of the individual FRET restraints. In this model, the 30 S subunit head tilts towards the 50 S subunit, similar to the movement found in comparing 30 S subunits and 70 S ribosomes from X-ray and cryo-electron microscope structures, and the platform is predicted to undergo a clock-wise rotation upon association.},

   Abstract = {Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) experiments probe molecular distances via distance dependent energy transfer from an excited donor dye to an acceptor dye. Single molecule experiments not only probe average distances, but also distance distributions or even fluctuations, and thus provide a powerful tool to study biomolecular structure and dynamics. However, the measured energy transfer efficiency depends not only on the distance between the dyes, but also on their mutual orientation, which is typically inaccessible to experiments. Thus, assumptions on the orientation distributions and averages are usually made, limiting the accuracy of the distance distributions extracted from FRET experiments. Here, we demonstrate that by combining single molecule FRET experiments with the mutual dye orientation statistics obtained from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, improved estimates of distances and distributions are obtained. From the simulated time-dependent mutual orientations, FRET efficiencies are calculated and the full statistics of individual photon absorption, energy transfer, and photon emission events is obtained from subsequent Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the FRET kinetics. All recorded emission events are collected to bursts from which efficiency distributions are calculated in close resemblance to the actual FRET experiment, taking shot noise fully into account. Using polyproline chains with attached Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 dyes as a test system, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by direct comparison to experimental data. We identified cis-isomers and different static local environments as sources of the experimentally observed heterogeneity. Reconstructions of distance distributions from experimental data at different levels of theory demonstrate how the respective underlying assumptions and approximations affect the obtained accuracy. Our results show that dye fluctuations obtained from MD simulations, combined with MC single photon kinetics, provide a versatile tool to improve the accuracy of distance distributions that can be extracted from measured single molecule FRET efficiencies.},

   Abstract = {Single molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments are a versatile method for investigating the conformational distributions and dynamics of biological macromolecules. In a common type of experiment, the fluorescence bursts from individual molecules freely diffusing in solution are detected as they pass through the observation volume of a confocal microscope. Correlation analysis of the fluorescence bursts shows that under typical experimental conditions, for time scales up to several tens of milliseconds, the probability for a molecule to return to the confocal volume is greater than the probability of a new molecule being detected. Here we present RASP (recurrence analysis of single particles), a method that is based on this recurrence behavior and allows us to significantly extend the information that can be extracted from single molecule FRET experiments. The number and peak shapes of subpopulations within the sample can be identified essentially in a model-free way by constructing recurrence FRET efficiency histograms. These are obtained by first selecting photon bursts from a small transfer efficiency range (initial bursts), and then building the FRET efficiency histogram only from bursts detected within a short time (the recurrence interval) after the initial bursts. Systematic variation of the recurrence interval allows the kinetics of interconversion between subpopulations to be determined on time scales from ~50 mus up to ~100 ms from equilibrium measurements. We demonstrate the applicability of the method on measurements of several peptides and proteins with different degrees of conformational heterogeneity and folding dynamics. The concepts presented here can be extended to other observables available from single molecule fluorescence experiments.},

   Abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measured at the single-molecule level can reveal conformational changes of biomolecules and intermolecular interactions in physiologically relevant conditions. Thus far single-molecule FRET has been measured only between two fluorophores. However, for many complex systems, the ability to observe changes in more than one distance is desired and FRET measured between three spectrally distinct fluorophores can provide a more complete picture. We have extended the single-molecule FRET technique to three colors, using the DNA four-way (Holliday) junction as a model system that undergoes two-state conformational fluctuations. By labeling three arms of the junction with Cy3 (donor), Cy5 (acceptor 1), and Cy5.5 (acceptor 2), distance changes between the donor and acceptor 1, and between the donor and acceptor 2, can be measured simultaneously. Thus we are able to show that the acceptor 1 arm moves away from the donor arm at the same time as the acceptor 2 arm approaches the donor arm, and vice versa, marking the first example of observing correlated movements of two different segments of a single molecule. Our data further suggest that Holliday junction does not spend measurable time with any of the helices unstacked, and that the parallel conformations are not populated to a detectable degree.},

   Abstract = {Single-molecule FRET (smFRET) has long been used as a molecular ruler for the study of biology on the nanoscale ( approximately 2-10 nm); smFRET in total-internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) Forster resonance energy transfer (TIRF-FRET) microscopy allows multiple biomolecules to be simultaneously studied with high temporal and spatial resolution. To operate at the limits of resolution of the technique, it is essential to investigate and rigorously quantify the major sources of noise and error; we used theoretical predictions, simulations, advanced image analysis, and detailed characterization of DNA standards to quantify the limits of TIRF-FRET resolution. We present a theoretical description of the major sources of noise, which was in excellent agreement with results for short-timescale smFRET measurements (<200 ms) on individual molecules (as opposed to measurements on an ensemble of single molecules). For longer timescales (>200 ms) on individual molecules, and for FRET distributions obtained from an ensemble of single molecules, we observed significant broadening beyond theoretical predictions; we investigated the causes of this broadening. For measurements on individual molecules, analysis of the experimental noise allows us to predict a maximum resolution of a FRET change of 0.08 with 20-ms temporal resolution, sufficient to directly resolve distance differences equivalent to one DNA basepair separation (0.34 nm). For measurements on ensembles of single molecules, we demonstrate resolution of distance differences of one basepair with 1000-ms temporal resolution, and differences of two basepairs with 80-ms temporal resolution. Our work paves the way for ultra-high-resolution TIRF-FRET studies on many biomolecules, including DNA processing machinery (DNA and RNA polymerases, helicases, etc.), the mechanisms of which are often characterized by distance changes on the scale of one DNA basepair.},

   Abstract = {Conformational dynamics are an important property of ribozymes and other RNA molecules but there is currently only limited information on the relationship between dynamics and RNA function. A recent structural study of the lead-dependent ribozyme, known as the leadzyme, showed significant dynamics at the active site and indicated that a structural rearrangement is required for the reaction to proceed from the ground to the transition state. In this work, microsecond-to-millisecond dynamics of the leadzyme are probed by analysis of the power dependence of (13)C NMR relaxation times in the rotating frame (T(1)(rho)). These results revealed a wide range of conformational dynamics for various residues in the leadzyme. For residue A25 in the active site, the power dependence of T(1)(rho) yielded an exchange lifetime similar to that previously measured by line-shape analysis, and provides an important calibration of this T(1)(rho) methodology for probing the dynamics of macromolecules. Strong evidence was also found for a previously suggested dynamic network of hydrogen bonds stabilizing the GAAA tetraloop motif. Within the active site of the leadzyme, internal motions are observed on a wide variety of time scales, suggesting a complex landscape of accessible states, and potential correlations between observed motions and catalytic function are discussed. These results demonstrate that the power dependence of (13)C T(1)(rho) relaxation times provides a valuable method for probing dynamics in nucleic acids.},

   Pages = {13231-41},
   Abstract = {Donor/acceptor (D/A) interactions are studied in a series of doubly modified 19-mer DNA duplexes. An ethynyl-linked Ru(II) donor nucleoside is maintained at the 5' terminus of each duplex, while an ethynyl-linked Os(II) nucleoside, placed on the complementary strands, is systematically moved toward the other terminus in three base pair increments. The steady-state Ru(II)-based luminescence quenching decreases from 90% at the shortest separation of 16 A (3 base pairs) to approximately 11% at the largest separation of 61 A (18 base pairs). Time-resolved experiments show a similar trend for the Ru(II) excited-state lifetime, and the decrease in the averaged excited-state lifetime for each duplex is linearly correlated with the fraction quenched obtained by steady-state measurements. Analysis according to the Forster dipole-dipole energy transfer mechanism shows a reasonable agreement. Deviation from idealized behavior is primarily attributed to uncertainty in the orientation factor, kappa(2). Analyzing D/A interactions in an analogous series of doubly modified oligonucleotides, where the ethynyl-linked Ru(II) center is replaced with a saturated two-carbon linked complex, yields an excellent correlation with the Forster mechanism. As this simple change partially relaxes the rigid geometry of the donor chromophore, these results suggest that the deviation from idealized Forster behavior observed for the duplexes containing the rigidly held Ru(II) center originates, at least partially, from ambiguities in the orientation factor. Surprisingly, analyzing both quenching data sets according to the Dexter mechanism also shows an excellent correlation. Although this can be interpreted as strong evidence for a Dexter triplet energy transfer mechanism, it does not imply that this electron exchange mechanism is operative in these D/A duplexes. Rather, it suggests that systems that transfer energy via the Forster mechanism can under certain circumstances exhibit Dexter-like "behavior", thus illustrating the danger of imposing a single physical model to describe D/A interactions in such complex systems. While we conclude that the Forster dipole-dipole energy transfer mechanism is the dominant pathway for D/A interactions in these modified oligonucleotides, a minor contribution from the Dexter electron exchange mechanism at short distances is likely. This complex behavior distinguishes DNA-bridged Ru(II)/Os(II) dyads from their corresponding low molecular-weight and covalently attached counterparts.},

The cyanine fluorophores are predominantly stacked on the ends of the helix in the manner of an additional base pair, and thus their relative orientation depends on the length of the helix. Observed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency depends on the length of the helix, as well as its helical periodicity. By changing the helical geometry from B form double-stranded DNA to A form hybrid RNA/DNA, a marked phase shift occurs in the modulation of FRET efficiency with helix length. Both curves are well explained by the standard geometry of B and A form helices. The observed modulation for both polymers is less than that calculated for a fully rigid attachment of the fluorophores. However, a model involving lateral mobility of the fluorophores on the ends of the helix explains the observed experimental data. This has been further modified to take account of a minor fraction of unstacked fluorophore observed by fluorescent lifetime measurements. Our data unequivocally establish that Forster transfer obeys the orientation dependence as expected for a dipole-dipole interaction.},

To facilitate proper fluorescence intensity measurements, we also evaluated instrument parameters that could impact the measurement. The apparent fluorescence intensity of isotropic samples depends on the sample emission anisotropy, fluorometer geometry, and optical apertures. We separate parameters of the sample, and those of the cylindrically symmetric illumination source and detector in the equations describing results of unpolarized and polarized fluorescence intensity measurements. This approach greatly simplifies calculations compared with the more universal method of Axelrod (1989). We provide a full computational method for calculating the Forster resonance energy transfer distance error and present a graph describing distance error in the simplest case.},

   Abstract = {Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in lithographically fabricated gold (Au) nanodisc pairs are investigated using microabsorption spectroscopy and electrodynamic simulations. In agreement with previous work, we find that the fractional plasmon wavelength shift for polarization along the interparticle axis decays nearly exponentially with the interparticle gap. In addition, we find that the decay length is roughly about 0.2 in units of the particle size for different nanoparticle size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. The near-exponential distance decay and the interesting "universal" scaling behavior of interparticle plasmon coupling can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a dipolar-coupling model as being due to the interplay of two factors: the direct dependence of the single-particle polarizability on the cubic power of the particle dimension and the decay of the plasmonic near-field as the cubic power of the inverse distance. Using this universal scaling behavior, we are able to derive a "plasmon ruler equation" that estimates the interparticle separation between Au nanospheres in a biological system from the observed fractional shift of the plasmon band. We find good agreement of the interparticle separations estimated using this equation with the experimental observations of Reinhard et al.},

   Abstract = {Lanthanides are attractive as biolabels because their long luminescence decay rates allow time-gated detection, which separates background scattering and fluorescence from the lanthanide emission. A stable and highly luminescent terbium complex based on a tetraisophthalamide (TIAM) chelate is paired with a polyaromatic-azo dark quencher (referred to as a Black Hole Quencher or BHQ) to prepare a series of 5'TIAM(Tb)/3'BHQ dual-labeled oligonucleotide probes with no secondary structure. Luminescence quenching efficiency within terbium/BHQ probes is very dependent on the terbium-BHQ distance. In an intact probe, the average terbium-BHQ distance is short, and Tb --> BHQ energy transfer is efficient, decreasing both the terbium emission intensity and lifetime. Upon hybridization or nuclease digestion, which spatially separate the Tb and BHQ moieties, the Tb luminescence intensity and lifetime increase. As a result, time-gated detection increases the emission intensity ratio of the unquenched probe/quenched probe due to the shorter lifetime of the quenched species. A 40-mer probe that has a 3-fold increase in steady-state luminescence upon digestion has a 50-fold increase when gated detection is used. This study demonstrates that time gating with lanthanide/dark quencher probes in energy transfer assays is an effective means of improving sensitivity.},

In the first motif, the central xanthene ring is stacked on one base of the adjacent cytosine-guanine DNA base pair, whereas one of the 2,3-dihydro-1-indolyl aromatic side rings is stacked on the other base. In the second motif, the QSY 21 stacking interaction with the DNA base pair is mediated only by one of the side rings. Several transitions between the motifs are observed during a MD simulation. The ab initio calculations show that none of these motifs is energetically preferred. Two binding motifs were found also for Rhodamine 6G, with the xanthene ring stacked predominantly either on the cytosine or on the guanine. These results suggest that the side rings of QSY 21 play a crucial role in its stacking on the DNA and indicate novel binding mode absent in the case of Rhodamine 6G, which lacks aromatic side rings.},

From the ensemble measurement of the fluorescence quenching via photoinduced electron transfer with a guanine base in the DNA sequence, three main conformations were found in aqueous solution: a conformation unaffected by the guanine base in the excited state lifetime of fluorescein, a conformation in which the fluorescence is dynamically quenched in the excited-state lifetime, and a conformation leading to rapid quenching via nonfluorescent complex. The analysis by using the parameters acquired from the ensemble measurements for interphoton time distribution histograms and FCS autocorrelations by the single-molecule measurement revealed that interconversion in these three conformations took place with two characteristic time constants of several hundreds of nanoseconds and tens of microseconds. The advantage of the combination use of the ensemble measurements with the single-molecule detections for rather complex dynamic motions is discussed by integrating the experimental results with those obtained by molecular dynamics simulation.},

   Abstract = {Probability distribution analysis (PDA) [M. Antonik et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, 6970] allows one to quantitatively analyze single-molecule (SM) data obtained in Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or fluorescence polarization experiments. By taking explicitly background and shot noise contributions into account, PDA accurately predicts the shape of one-dimensional histograms of various parameters, such as FRET efficiency or fluorescence anisotropy. In order to describe complex experimental SM-FRET or polarization data obtained for systems consisting of multiple non-interconverting fluorescent states, several extensions to the PDA theory are presented. Effects of brightness variations and multiple-molecule events are considered independently of the detection volume parameters by using only the overall experimental signal intensity distribution. The extended PDA theory can now be applied to analyze any mixture, by using any a priori model or a model-free deconvolution approach based on the maximum entropy method (MEM). The accuracy of the analysis and the number of free parameters are limited only by data quality. Correction of the PDA model function for the presence of multiple-molecule events allows one to measure at high SM concentrations to avoid artifacts due to a very long measurement time. Tools such as MEM and combined mean donor fluorescence lifetime analysis have been developed to distinguish whether extra broadening of PDA histograms could be attributed to structural heterogeneities or dye artifacts. In this way, an ultimate resolution in FRET experiments in the range of a few Angstrom is achieved which allows for molecular Angstrom optics distinguishing between a set of fixed distances and a distribution of distances. The extended theory is verified by analyzing simulations and experimental data.},

   Abstract = {Two complementary methods in confocal single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy are presented to analyze conformational dynamics by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements considering simulated and experimental data. First, an extension of photon distribution analysis (PDA) is applied to characterize conformational exchange between two or more states via global analysis of the shape of FRET peaks for different time bins. PDA accurately predicts the shape of FRET efficiency histograms in the presence of FRET fluctuations, taking into account shot noise and background contributions. Dynamic-PDA quantitatively recovers FRET efficiencies of the interconverting states and relaxation times of dynamics on the time scale of the diffusion time t(d) (typically milliseconds), with a dynamic range of the method of about +/-1 order of magnitude with respect to t(d). Correction procedures are proposed to consider the factors limiting the accuracy of dynamic-PDA, such as brightness variations, shortening of the observation time due to diffusion, and a contribution of multimolecular events. Second, an analysis procedure for multiparameter fluorescence detection is presented, where intensity-derived FRET efficiency is correlated with the fluorescence lifetime of the donor quenched by FRET. If a maximum likelihood estimator is applied to compute a mean fluorescence lifetime of mixed states, one obtains a fluorescence weighted mean lifetime. Thus a mixed state is detected by a characteristic shift of the fluorescence lifetime, which becomes longer than that expected for a single species with the same intensity-derived FRET efficiency. Analysis tools for direct visual inspection of two-dimensional diagrams of FRET efficiency versus donor lifetime are presented for the cases of static and dynamic FRET. Finally these new techniques are compared with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.},

The results indicate that the mean DNA bend angle is 77(+/-3) degrees - consistent with the mean DNA bend angle observed in crystallographic structures (80(+/-12) degrees ). Lifetime-distribution analysis indicates that the distribution of DNA bend angles is relatively narrow, with <10 % of DNA bend angles exceeding 100 degrees. Millisecond time-resolved luminescence measurements using lanthanide-chelate probes provide independent evidence that the upper limit of the distribution of DNA bend angles is approximately 100 degrees. The methods used here will permit mutational analysis of CAP-induced DNA bending and the role of CAP-induced DNA bending in transcriptional activation.},

This was performed by labeling biomolecules with fluorophores that serve as donor-acceptor pairs for Forster resonance energy transfer, and by using alternating-laser excitation to excite directly both donors and acceptors present in single diffusing molecules. Emissions were reduced to the distance-dependent ratio E, and a distance-independent, stoichiometry-based ratio S. Histograms of E and S sorted species based on the conformation and association status of each species. S was sensitive to the stoichiometry and relative brightness of fluorophores in single molecules, observables that can monitor oligomerization and local-environment changes, respectively. FAMS permits equilibrium and kinetic analysis of macromolecule-ligand interactions; this was validated by measuring equilibrium and kinetic dissociation constants for the interaction of Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein with DNA. FAMS is a general platform for ratiometric measurements that report on structure, dynamics, stoichiometries, environment, and interactions of diffusing or immobilized molecules, thus enabling detailed mechanistic studies and ultrasensitive diagnostics.},

The new method is applicable to any continuous data which clusters around discrete values and exhibits multiple transitions between these values such as tethered particle motion data or Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) spectra. The algorithms developed have been shown to perform well on simulated data, demonstrating the ability to recover the model used to generate the data under high noise, sparse data conditions and the ability to infer the existence of degenerate states. They have also been applied to new experimental FRET data of Holliday Junction dynamics, extracting the expected two state model and providing values for the transition rates in good agreement with previous results and with results obtained using existing maximum likelihood based methods. The method differs markedly from previous Markov-model reconstructions in being able to uncover truly hidden states.},

The spin labels were attached to the 2'-NH2 positions of appropriately placed uridines in the duplexes, and interspin distances were measured from both molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and Fourier deconvolution methods (FD) [13]. The 10-mer duplexes have interspin distances ranging from 10 Angstrom to 30 Angstrom based on MD; however, dipolar line broadening of the CW EPR spectrum is only observed for the RNAs for predicted interspin distances of 10-21 Angstrom and not for distances over 25 Angstrom. The conformational changes in TAR (transactivating responsive region) RNA in the presence and in the absence of different divalent metal ions were monitored by measuring distances between two nucleotides in the bulge region. The predicted interspin distances obtained from the FD method and those from MD calculations match well for both the model RNA duplexes and the structural changes predicted for TAR RNA. These results demonstrate that distance measurement using EPR spectroscopy is a potentially powerful method to help predict the structures of RNA molecules.},

   Abstract = {The biological functions of nucleic acids in processes of DNA replication, transcription, homologous recombination, mRNA translation, and ribozyme catalysis are intimately linked to their three-dimensional structures and to conformational changes induced by proteins, metal ions and other ligands. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a powerful technique for probing the structure and conformational dynamics of biological macromolecules under a wide range of solution conditions. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) provides long-range distance information from 10 to 100 A, a range that is useful for probing the global structure of nucleic acids. While steady-state measurements of FRET provide the average distance between donor and acceptor, much more information is available from the analysis of the nanosecond emission decay of the donor in time-resolved FRET (trFRET) experiments. Analysis of the decay in terms of donor-acceptor distance distributions can resolve different conformers in a heterogeneous mixture, providing information on the global structure and flexibility of each species as well as their equilibrium populations. In this review, we outline the principles of trFRET and the methods used to incorporate fluorescent probes into DNA and RNA. Examples of specific applications are presented to illustrate the versatility of trFRET as a tool to define global structures, to identify conformational heterogeneity and flexibility, to investigate the energetics of tertiary structure formation and to probe structural rearrangements of nucleic acids.},

Mononucleosomes, reconstituted with DNA containing a FRET pair at the dyad axis and exit of the nucleosome core particle, were immobilized through a 30 bp DNA tether on a polyethyleneglycol functionalized slide and visualized using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy. FRET efficiency time-traces revealed two types of dynamics: acceptor blinking and intramolecular rearrangements. Both Cy5 and ATTO647N acceptor dyes showed severe blinking in a deoxygenated buffer in the presence of 2% betaME. Replacing the triplet quencher betaME with 1 mM Trolox eliminated most blinking effects. After suppression of blinking three subpopulations were observed: 90% appeared as dissociated complexes; the remaining 10% featured an average FRET efficiency in agreement with intact nucleosomes. In 97% of these intact nucleosomes no significant changes in FRET efficiency were observed in the experimentally accessible time window ranging from 10 ms to 10's of seconds. However, 3% of the intact nucleosomes showed intervals with reduced FRET efficiency, clearly distinct from blinking, with a lifetime of 120 ms. These fluctuations can unambiguously be attributed to DNA breathing. Our findings illustrate not only the merits but also typical caveats encountered in single-molecule FRET studies on complex biological systems.},

Transient unwrapping of DNA from nucleosome ends can provide an intrinsic exposure of wrapped DNA, allowing proteins to bind DNA that would otherwise be occluded in the nucleosome. The molecular details underlying these mechanisms remain to be resolved. Here we show how DNA unwrapping occurs progressively from both nucleosome ends. We performed single-pair fluorescence resonance energy transfer (spFRET) spectroscopy with alternating laser excitation (ALEX) on nucleosomes either in free solution or confined in a gel after PAGE separation. We combined ALEX-spFRET with a correlation analysis on selected bursts of fluorescence, to resolve a variety of unwrapped nucleosome conformations. The experiments reveal that nucleosomes are unwrapped with an equilibrium constant of approximately 0.2-0.6 at nucleosome ends and approximately 0.1 at a location 27 basepairs inside the nucleosome, but still remain stably associated. Our findings, obtained using a powerful combination of single-molecule fluorescence techniques and gel electrophoresis, emphasize the delicate interplay between DNA accessibility and condensation in chromatin.},

   Abstract = {Single-pair Forster resonance energy transfer (spFRET) experiments using single-molecule burst analysis on a confocal microscope are an ideal tool to measure inter- and intramolecular distances and dynamics on the nanoscale. Different techniques have been developed to maximize the amount of information available in spFRET burst analysis experiments. Multiparameter fluorescence detection (MFD) is used to monitor a variety of fluorescence parameters simultaneously and pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE) employs direct excitation of the acceptor to probe its presence and photoactivity. To calculate accurate FRET efficiencies from spFRET experiments with MFD or PIE, several calibration measurements are usually required. Herein, we demonstrate that by combining MFD with PIE information regarding all calibration factors as well as an accurate determination of spFRET histograms can be performed in a single measurement. In addition, the quality of overlap of the different detection volumes as well as the detection of acceptor photophysics can be investigated with MFD-PIE. Bursts containing acceptor photobleaching can be identified and excluded from further investigation while bursts that contain FRET dynamics are unaffected by this analysis. We have employed MFD-PIE to accurately analyze the effects of nucleotides and substrate on the interdomain separation in DnaK, the major bacterial heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). The interdomain distance increases from 47 A in the ATP-bound state to 84 A in the ADP-bound state and slightly contracts to 77 A when a substrate is bound. This is in contrast to what was observed for the mitochondrial member of the Hsp70s, Ssc1, supporting the notion of evolutionary specialization of Hsp70s for different cellular functions in different organisms and cell organelles.},

   Abstract = {In this review a short introduction to the concept and experimental realization of single molecule multiparameter fluorescence spectroscopy is presented. The approach of Multiparameter Fluorescence Detection (MFD) is essentially the time-resolved observation of all five intrinsic properties of a chromophore that can be probed in a fluorescence experiment, i.e. spectral properties of absorption and fluorescence, F(lambda(A), lambda), fluorescence quantum yield, Phi(F), fluorescence lifetime, tau, and anisotropy, r. This harbors the potential to combine Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) and Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) in a single experiment. Additionally, species selective analysis of subensembles and even direct studies on single molecule dynamics become accessible.
The application of MFD to complex multichromophoric systems is discussed. Examples range from studies of Donor-Acceptor pairs showing intra- or intermolecular Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) for revealing dynamical and statical structural informations of biologically relevant macromolecules to the development of vastly improved analytical tools for the accurate identification of target molecules in multicomponent systems as needed in todays and future High-Throughput Screening (HTS) efforts.
Many theoretical models of interactions and chemical reactions have been described on the molecular level although the primary source for our knowledge on chemical structure and dynamics so far are studies on molecule ensembles. Such studies, however, did not yet provide an answer to the question whether all members of the ensemble have the same properties. Here, experiments on single molecules promise new and unexpected insights, because they eliminate ensemble averaging and provide direct information on heterogeneity and kinetics of the system. That way distributions and spectra of different species in specific states are directly accessible even in heterogeneous systems (Fig.1).},

Here, we present the design and characterization of a supramolecular Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) system by using a fluorescent protein bound to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), a fluorophore attached to a second ssDNA molecule, and a complementary strand for hybridizing the two fluorophores together. The FRET efficiency was studied by using both ensemble and single-pair FRET measurements. The distance between the two fluorophores was determined from the single-pair FRET efficiency and could be described by a simple cylindrical model for the DNA. Hence, DNA can be used as a scaffold for positioning fluorescent proteins, as well as traditional fluorophores, with nanometer accuracy and shows great potential for use in the future of nanobiotechnology.},

   Abstract = {In this work, the photophysical properties of two oxazine dyes (ATTO 610 and ATTO 680) covalently attached via a C6-amino linker to the 5'-end of short single-stranded as well as double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA, respectively) of different lengths were investigated. The two oxazine dyes were chosen because of the excellent spectral overlap, the high extinction coefficients, and the high fluorescence quantum yield of ATTO 610, making them an attractive Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair for bioanalytical applications in the far-red spectral range. To identify possible molecular dye-DNA interactions that cause photophysical alterations, we performed a detailed spectroscopic study, including time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements. As an effect of the DNA conjugation, the absorption and fluorescence maxima of both dyes were bathochromically shifted and the fluorescence decay times were increased. Moreover, the absorption of conjugated ATTO 610 was spectrally broadened, and a dual fluorescence emission was observed. Steric interactions with ssDNA as well as dsDNA were found for both dyes. The dye-DNA interactions were strengthened from ssDNA to dsDNA conjugates, pointing toward interactions with specific dsDNA domains (such as the top of the double helix). Although these interactions partially blocked the dye-linker rotation, a free (unhindered) rotational mobility of at least one dye facilitated the appropriate alignment of the transition dipole moments in doubly labeled ATTO 610/ATTO 680-dsDNA conjugates for the performance of successful FRET. Considering the high linker flexibility for the determination of the donor-acceptor distances, good accordance between theoretical and experimental FRET parameters was obtained. The considerably large Forster distance of approximately 7 nm recommends the application of this FRET pair not only for the detection of binding reactions between nucleic acids in living cells but also for monitoring interactions of larger biomolecules such as proteins.},

   Abstract = {8-17 is a DNAzyme with metal-dependent endoribonuclease activity. Recently, a variant termed 8-17NG was reported as the first nucleic acid enzyme capable of cleaving all 16 dinucleotide junctions of RNA with rate enhancements ranging from 1000- to 1,000,000,000-fold over background activity. We attributed this broad-ranging cleavage efficiency to global folding of the DNAzyme. We sought to examine the influence of dinucleotides at the cleavage site of 8-17NG on global folding by using three-color (3c) FRET. By comparing the folding of 8-17NG with all 16 possible dinucleotide junctions, we found all examined DNAzyme-substrate constructs adopted a two-step folding process in the presence of Mn(2+), which was consistent with previous metal-induced folding studies of 8-17. Interestingly, Mn(2+) titration experiments also suggest that the second folding step is dependent on dinucleotide identity: purine-purine junctions allowed 8-17NG to fold at lower concentrations than pyrimidine-pyrimidine linkages. This finding was corroborated by RNA cleavage assays, in which the largest improvement in cleavage yield was observed in pyrimidine-pyrimidine junctions when [Mn(2+)] was increased. Taken together, these results support the previously observed hierarchy of 8-17 activity for different cleavage sites. Complemented by earlier sequence and structure-function studies, this investigation allowed for the first detailed examination of crucial relationships between the structural influence and junction preferences of nucleic acid-catalyzed RNA cleavage reactions.},

We show that the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) 3 and 4 of PTB can bind two distant pyrimidine tracts and bring their 5' and 3' ends in close proximity, thus looping the RNA. Efficient looping requires an intervening sequence of 15 nucleotides or longer between the pyrimidine tracts. RRM3 and RRM4 bind the 5' and the 3' pyrimidine tracts, respectively, in a specific directionality and work synergistically for efficient splicing repression in vivo.},

The resulting conjugates revealed similar fluorescence emission intensity to the unconjugated proteins, and the functionality of the tethered oligonucleotide was proven by specific Watson-Crick base pairing to cDNA-modified gold nanoparticles. Fluorescence spectroscopy analysis indicated that the fluorescence of the FP is quenched by the gold particle, and the extent of quenching varied with the intrinsic spectroscopic properties of FP as well as with the configuration of surface attachment. Since this study demonstrates that biological fluorophores can be selectively incorporated into and optically coupled with nanoparticle-based devices, applications in DNA-based nanofabrication can be foreseen.},

Freely diffusing molecules are sorted into subpopulations based on single-molecule signals detected within 100 micros to 1 ms. Distance distributions caused by fluctuations faster than 100 micros are studied within these subpopulations by using time-correlated single-photon counting. Measured distance distributions for dsDNA can be accounted for by considering fluorophore linkers and fluorophore rotational diffusion, except that we find smaller fluctuations for internally labeled dsDNA than DNA with one of the fluorophores positioned at a terminal site. We find that the electrostatic portion of the persistence length of short single-stranded poly(dT) varies approximately as the ionic strength (I) to the -1/2 power (I(-1/2)), and that the average contribution to the contour length per base is 0.40-0.45 nm. We study unfolded chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) and unfolded acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) even under conditions where folded and unfolded subpopulations coexist (contributions from folded proteins are excluded by using alternating-laser excitation). At lower denaturant concentrations, unfolded CI2 and ACBP are more compact and display larger fluctuations than at higher denaturant concentrations where only unfolded proteins are present. The experimentally measured fluctuations are larger than the fluctuations predicted from a Gaussian chain model or a wormlike chain model. We propose that the larger fluctuations may indicate transient residual structure in the unfolded state.},

ALEX yields accurate FRET independent of instrumental factors, such as excitation intensity or detector alignment.

Distance measurements within transcription complexes agreed well with ensemble-FRET measurements, and with structural models based on ensemble-FRET and x-ray crystallography.

   Abstract = {The folding of 8-17 deoxyribozyme was investigated by three-color alternating-laser excitation (3c-ALEX), a new single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method we recently developed. Since 3c-ALEX has the capability of simultaneously sorting fluorescent molecules based on their labeling status and monitoring three interprobe distances of a biomolecule by employing three-color FRET, it is an ideal tool to study folding of multibranched molecules. The 8-17 deoxyribozyme, a DNA enzyme that cleaves a specific RNA substrate, is a good model system for a multibranched molecule, since it has the structure of a three-way DNA junction with a bulge. Labeling all three branches of the 8-17 with different fluorescent probes, we studied its [Mg2+]-dependent folding in a Na+ buffer solution. With the stoichiometric sorting capability of 3c-ALEX, we first selected only the triply labeled 8-17 in a solution of all heterogeneous mixtures and then simultaneously measured all three interprobe distances of the selected species. Our results show that the 8-17 folds into a pyramidal form upon increasing [Mg2+], in a similar way with [Zn2+] as found in an earlier study conducted at the ensemble level. The apparent dissociation constant of Mg2+ was more than 100 times larger than that of Zn2+ and showed considerable variance with buffer concentration. No clear sign of two-step folding was observed for Mg2+, in contrast to the case of Zn2+. Compared with the hammerhead ribozyme, the 8-17 was found to require 10 times higher [Mg2+] to undergo folding. By comparison with the folding of several inactive 8-17 analogues, we found that the two conserved sequences (A and G) of the triad loop of the shortest branch are critical elements for folding, especially for the folding at low [Mg2+]. Our results suggest that the role of the stem loop is to provide a scaffold for the two bases to be properly positioned for the necessary interaction and that the two bases are directly involved in the interaction that plays a critical role in folding. This work demonstrates that 3c-ALEX is a powerful single-molecule method to study the structure and folding of complex and multibranched biomolecules.},

   Abstract = {Fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides and DNA fragments have promise in nucleic acid research with applications that include DNA hybridization, automated DNA sequencing, fluorescence anisotropy, and resonance energy transfer studies. Past concerns with fluorescent-labeled DNA arose from interactions between fluorophores and DNA that result in quenched fluorescence. This quenching phenomenon is most problematic in fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies because quenching of the donor fluorescence could result from either resonance energy transfer or nontransfer effects. In the present study, relief of nontransfer quenching of a 14-mer fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled oligonucleotide containing the BamHI restriction site was characterized with both steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques. The FITC-labeled single strand was best fit by a triexponential decay with lifetimes of 0.5, 2.7, and 4.2 ns. The 4.2-ns component was found to contribute more than 80% of the total steady-state intensity. Upon annealing with an unmodified complementary strand, the contribution from the 4.2-ns component was significantly decreased, resulting in twofold quenching of total fluorescence. We reasoned that this quenching phenomenon should be a reversible process and could be employed to study strand separation processes in molecular biology. Hence, cleavage of the fluorescently labeled substrate was examined using DNAase I and BamHI restriction endonuclease. Our results show that the quenched fluorescence is totally recovered upon cleavage (compared to that of the single strand). The extent of cleavage measured by fluorescence was confirmed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. We believe this fluorescence "dequenching" technique may be used to quantify the kinetics of other DNA strand separation and cleavage processes in molecular biology.},

   Abstract = {The breakthroughs in single molecule spectroscopy of the last decade and the recent advances in super resolution microscopy have boosted the popularity of cyanine dyes in biophysical research. These applications have motivated the investigation of the reactions and relaxation processes that cyanines undergo in their electronically excited states. Studies show that the triplet state is a key intermediate in the photochemical reactions that limit the photostability of cyanine dyes. The removal of oxygen greatly reduces photobleaching, but induces rapid intensity fluctuations (blinking). The existence of non-fluorescent states lasting from milliseconds to seconds was early identified as a limitation in single-molecule spectroscopy and a potential source of artifacts. Recent studies demonstrate that a combination of oxidizing and reducing agents is the most efficient way of guaranteeing that the ground state is recovered rapidly and efficiently. Thiol-containing reducing agents have been identified as the source of long-lived dark states in some cyanines that can be photochemically switched back to the emissive state. The mechanism of this process is the reversible addition of the thiol-containing compound to a double bond in the polymethine chain resulting in a non-fluorescent molecule. This process can be reverted by irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Another mechanism that leads to non-fluorescent states in cyanine dyes is cis-trans isomerization from the singlet-excited state. This process, which competes with fluorescence, involves the rotation of one-half of the molecule with respect to the other with an efficiency that depends strongly on steric effects. The efficiency of fluorescence of most cyanine dyes has been shown to depend dramatically on their molecular environment within the biomolecule. For example, the fluorescence quantum yield of Cy3 linked covalently to DNA depends on the type of linkage used for attachment, DNA sequence and secondary structure. Cyanines linked to the DNA termini have been shown to be mostly stacked at the end of the helix, while cyanines linked to the DNA internally are believed to partially bind to the minor or major grooves. These interactions not only affect the photophysical properties of the probes but also create a large uncertainty in their orientation.},

   Abstract = {The theory of fluorescent emission anisotropy [r(t)] of a cylindrical probe in a membrane suspension is developed. It is shown, independent of any model, that the limiting anisotropy [r(infinity)] is proportional to the square to the order parameter of the probe. The order parameter determines the first nontrivial term in the expansion of the equilibrium orientational distribution function of the probe in a series of Legendre polynomials. Following Kinosita, Kawato, and Ikegami, the motion of the probe is described as diffusion ("wobbling") within a cone of semiangle theta 0. Within the framework of this model, an accurate single-exponential approximation for r(t) is considered. An analytic expression relating the effective relaxation time, which appears in the above approximation, to theta 0 and the diffusion coefficient for wobbling is derived. The model is generalized to the situation where the probe is attached to a macromolecule whose motion cannot be neglected on the time scale of the fluorescence experiment. Finally, by exploiting the formal similarity between the theory of fluorescence depolarization and 13C-NMR dipolar relaxation, expressions for T1, T2, and the nuclear Overhauser enhancement are derived for a protonated carbon which is nonrigidly attached to a macromolecule and undergoes librational motion described as diffusion on a spherical "cap" of semiangle theta 0.},

   Abstract = {A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) study of biomolecules typically employs two fluorophores. The increasing number of branches and complexity of biomolecules call for simultaneously monitoring structures and dynamics of several branches in a single system. Furthermore, despite recent studies that show DNAzymes can be a stable and cost-effective alternative to protein and ribozymes for pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications, no FRET study of DNAzymes has been reported. Here, we describe the FRET study of a trifluorophore-labeled "8-17" DNAzyme, in which each of the three branches is labeled with a different fluorophore. From the study, we found that the (ratio)(A) method that has been commonly used in dual-fluorophore-labeled systems is also applicable to trifluorophore-labeled systems. However, while both FRET efficiency and fluorophore-to-fluorophore distance can be used to measure FRET in dual-fluorophore-labeled systems, only the average distance should be used in trifluorophore-labeled systems. The ability to monitor all three branches in a single system allowed us to reveal new metal-ion-dependent conformational changes in the DNAzyme. The trifluorophore-labeled "8-17" DNAzyme has been found to adopt a two-step folding process in the presence of Zn(2+). Each step is induced by one Zn(2+) binding, with apparent dissociation constants of 19 microM and 260 microM for binding the first and second Zn(2+), respectively. The trifluorophore FRET results are verified by a dual-labeled control experiment. The results demonstrated that the trifluorophore-labeled system is simple and yet powerful in studying complicated biomolecular structure and dynamics and is capable of revealing new sophisticated structural changes that may have functional implications.},

By labeling the 5'-ends of these DNA molecules with donor and acceptor fluorescent dyes, we were able to measure the distance between the dyes by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and model DNA distortion. The FRET efficiency decreased from 0.49 +/- 0.01 (nicked DNA) to 0.37 +/- 0.01 (intact DNA) when the gap in the DNA strand was closed. The measured dye-to-dye distance of IHF in complex with nicked DNA was in agreement with the expected value from the crystal structure. Although we found that the two structures were distinguishable, the global shape induced by IHF was retained between the two DNA molecules. Furthermore, our FRET and modeling techniques have sufficiently high resolution to distinguish subtle changes in nucleoprotein complexes with biological relevance.},

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we have determined the changes in the end-to-end distance consequent on the binding of selected insect counterparts of HMG1 to two DNA fragments, one of 18 bp containing a single dA(2) bulge and a second of 27 bp with two dA(2) bulges. The observed changes are consistent with overall bend angles for the complex of the single HMG domain with one bulge and of two domains with two bulges of approximately 90-100 degrees and approximately 180-200 degrees, respectively. The former value contrasts with an inferred value of 150 degrees reported by Heyduk et al. (1) for the bend induced by a single domain. We also observe that the induced bend angle is unaffected by the presence of the C-terminal acidic region. The DNA bend of approximately 95 degrees observed in the HMG domain complexes is similar in magnitude to that induced by the TATA-binding protein (80 degrees), each monomeric unit of the integration host factor (80 degrees), and the LEF-1 HMG domain (107 degrees). We suggest this value may represent a steric limitation on the extent of DNA bending induced by a single DNA-binding motif.},

We discuss ways to contend with complexities when using FRET to measure distance changes within large multi-subunit macromolecular complexes, such as the ribosome. Complications can arise due to non-stoichiometric labeling of donor and acceptor probes, as well as environmental effects that are specific to each conjugation site. We show how to account for changes in extinction coefficients, quenching, labeling stoichiometry and other variations in the spectroscopic properties of the dye to enable more accurate calculation of distances from FRET data. We also discuss approximations that concern the orientation of the transition moments of the two dye molecules, as well as the impact of other errors in the measurement of absolute distances. Thirteen dye-pair locations with different distances using 18 independent FRET pairs conjugated to specific 30 S protein residues have been used to determine distance changes within the 30 S subunit upon association with the 50 S subunit, forming the 70 S ribosome.

A coumarin donor and a Cy3 acceptor were positioned at opposite ends of a 23-bp double helical DNA oligomer. In the absence of silver particles the extent of RET is near 9%, consistent with a Forster distance R-0 near 50 Angstrom and a donor to acceptor distance near 75 A. The transfer efficiency increased when the solution of AMCA-DNA-Cy3 was placed between two quartz plates coated with silver island films to near 64%, as determined by both steady-state and time-resolved measurements. The apparent R-0 in the presence of silver island films increases to about 110Angstrom. These values of the transfer efficiency and R-0 represent weighted averages for donor-acceptor pairs near and distant from the metallic surfaces, so that the values at an optimal distance are likely to be larger. The increased energy transfer is observed only between two sandwiched silvered slides. When we replaced one silvered slide with a quartz plate the effect vanished. Also, the increased energy transfer was not observed for silvered slides separated more than a few micrometers. These results suggest the use of metal-enhanced RET in PCR, hybridization, and other DNA assays, and the possibility of controlling energy transfer by the distance between silver surfaces.

The Forster distances for these FRET-pairs in single- and double-stranded DNA conjugates have been determined. In particular, it should be noted that the quantum yield of the donors Cy3 and TAMRA varies between single- and double-stranded DNA. While this alters the Forster distance for a donor-acceptor pair, this also allows for detection of thermal denaturation events with a single non-intercalating fluorophore. The utility of FRET in the development of nucleic acid biosensor technology is illustrated by using TAMRA and IabRQ as a FRET pair in selectivity experiments. The differential quenching of TAMRA fluorescence by IabRQ in solution has been used to discriminate between 0 and 3 base pair mismatches at 60 degrees C for a 19 base sequence. At room temperature, the quenching of TAMRA fluorescence was not an effective indicator of the degree of base pair mismatch. There appears to be a threshold of duplex stability at room temperature which occurs beyond two base pair mismatches and reverses the observed trend in TAMRA fluorescence prior to that degree of mismatch. When this experimental system is transferred to a glass surface through covalent coupling and organosilane chemistry, the observed trend in TAMRA fluorescence at room temperature is similar to that obtained in bulk solution, but without a threshold of duplex stability. In addition to quenching of fluorescence by FRET, it is believed that several other quenching mechanisms are occurring at the surface.},

   Abstract = {We report a novel molecular ruler for measurement of distances and distance distributions with accurate external calibration. Using solution X-ray scattering we determine the scattering interference between two gold nanocrystal probes attached site-specifically to a macromolecule of interest. Fourier transformation of the interference pattern provides a model-independent probability distribution for the distances between the probe centers-of-mass. To test the approach, we measure end-to-end distances for a variety of DNA structures. We demonstrate that measurements with independently prepared samples and using different X-ray sources are highly reproducible, we demonstrate the quantitative accuracy of the first and second moments of the distance distributions, and we demonstrate that the technique recovers complex distribution shapes. Distances measured with the solution scattering-interference ruler match the corresponding crystallographic values, but differ from distances measured previously with alternate ruler techniques. The X-ray scattering interference ruler should be a powerful tool for relating crystal structures to solution structures and for studying molecular fluctuations.},

   Abstract = {Microscopy-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments measure donor and acceptor intensities by isolating these signals with a series of optical elements. Because this filtering discards portions of the spectrum, the observed FRET efficiency is dependent on the set of filters in use. Similarly, observed FRET efficiency is also affected by differences in fluorophore quantum yield. Recovering the absolute FRET efficiency requires normalization for these effects to account for differences between the donor and acceptor fluorophores in their quantum yield and detection efficiency. Without this correction, FRET is consistent across multiple experiments only if the photophysical and instrument properties remain unchanged. Here we present what is, to our knowledge, the first systematic study of methods to recover the true FRET efficiency using DNA rulers with known fluorophore separations. We varied optical elements to purposefully alter observed FRET and examined protein samples to achieve quantum yields distinct from those in the DNA samples. Correction for calculated instrument transmission reduced FRET deviations, which can facilitate comparison of results from different instruments. Empirical normalization was more effective but required significant effort. Normalization based on single-molecule photobleaching was the most effective depending on how it is applied. Surprisingly, per-molecule gamma-normalization reduced the peak width in the DNA FRET distribution because anomalous gamma-values correspond to FRET outliers. Thus, molecule-to-molecule variation in gamma has an unrecognized effect on the FRET distribution that must be considered to extract information on sample dynamics from the distribution width.},

   Abstract = {The analysis of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) trajectories has become one of significant biophysical interest. In deducing the transition rates between various states of a system for time-binned data, researchers have relied on simple, but often arbitrary methods of extracting rates from FRET trajectories. Although these methods have proven satisfactory in cases of well-separated, low-noise, two- or three-state systems, they become less reliable when applied to a system of greater complexity. We have developed an analysis scheme that casts single-molecule time-binned FRET trajectories as hidden Markov processes, allowing one to determine, based on probability alone, the most likely FRET-value distributions of states and their interconversion rates while simultaneously determining the most likely time sequence of underlying states for each trajectory. Together with a transition density plot and Bayesian information criterion we can also determine the number of different states present in a system in addition to the state-to-state transition probabilities. Here we present the algorithm and test its limitations with various simulated data and previously reported Holliday junction data. The algorithm is then applied to the analysis of the binding and dissociation of three RecA monomers on a DNA construct.},

Our single-molecule fluorescence studies provide unique insight into the energy landscape of Holliday junctions by visualizing these processes directly. In the hairpin ribozyme, an RNA four-way junction is an important structural element that enhances active-site formation by several orders of magnitude. Our single-molecule studies suggest a plausible mechanism for how the junction achieves this remarkable feat; the structural dynamics of the four-way junction bring about frequent contacts between the loops that are needed to form the active site. The most definitive evidence for this is the observation of three-state folding in single-hairpin ribozymes, the intermediate state of which is populated due to the intrinsic properties of the junction.},

In PIE, multiple excitation sources are interleaved such that the fluorescence emission generated from one pulse is complete before the next excitation pulse arrives. Hence, the excitation source for each detected photon is known. Typical repetition rates used for PIE are between approximately 1 and 50 MHz. PIE has many applications in various fluorescence methods. Using PIE, dual-color measurements can be performed with a single detector. In fluorescence imaging with multicolor detection, spectral cross talk can be removed, improving the contrast of the image. Using PIE with FCCS, we can eliminate spectral cross talk, making the method sensitive to weaker interactions. FCCS measurements with complexes that undergo FRET can be analyzed quantitatively. Under specific conditions, the FRET efficiency can be determined directly from the amplitude of the measured correlation functions without any calibration factors. We also show the application of PIE to spFRET measurements, where complexes that have low FRET efficiency can be distinguished from those that do not have an active acceptor.},

   Abstract = {With recent growth in the use of fluorescence-detected resonance energy transfer (FRET), it is being applied to complex systems in modern and diverse ways where it is not always clear that the common approximations required for analysis are applicable. For instance, the ideal dipole approximation (IDA), which is implicit in the Forster equation, is known to break down when molecules get "too close" to each other. Yet, no clear definition exists of what is meant by "too close". Here we examine several common fluorescent probe molecules to determine boundaries for use of the IDA. We compare the Coulombic coupling determined essentially exactly with a linear response approach with the IDA coupling to find the distance regimes over which the IDA begins to fail. We find that the IDA performs well down to roughly 20 A separation, provided the molecules sample an isotropic set of relative orientations. However, if molecular motions are restricted, the IDA performs poorly at separations beyond 50 A. Thus, isotropic probe motions help mask poor performance of the IDA through cancellation of error. Therefore, if fluorescent probe motions are restricted, FRET practitioners should be concerned with not only the well-known kappa2 approximation, but also possible failure of the IDA.},

Here we use fluorescence energy transfer to determine the relative distances between the ends of a small DNA junction, and hence the path of the strands. Our results are consistent with the geometry of an 'X'. The interconnected helices are juxtaposed so that the continuous strands of each helix generate an antiparallel alignment, and the two interchanged strands do not cross at the centre. The acute angle of the X structure is defined by a right-handed rotation of the helical axes about the axis perpendicular to the X plane, as viewed from the centre of the X.},

In particular we show that global data analysis of complete FRET networks is beneficial and that the measurement of FRET anisotropies in addition to FRET efficiencies can be used to determine accurately both position and orientation of the dyes. This measurement scheme improves localization accuracy substantially, and we can show that the improvement is a consequence of the more precise information about the transition dipole moment orientation of the dyes obtained by FRET anisotropy measurements. We discuss also rigid body docking of different macromolecules by means of NPS, which can be used to study the structure of macromolecular complexes. Finally, we combine our approach with common FRET analysis methods to determine the number of states of a macromolecule.},

   Abstract = {We studied fluorescence intensity, polarization and lifetime of some commonly used fluorophores conjugated to oligodeoxyribonucleotides with different primary and secondary structures. We found that fluorescence intensity can increase or decrease upon hybridization of the labeled strand to its complement depending on the sequence and position of the fluorophore. Up to 10-fold quenching of the fluorescence upon hybridization was observed when the dye moiety was attached close to the 3' end and the 3'-terminal base was either dG or dC. No quenching upon hybridization was observed when the dye was positioned within the same sequence context but close to the 5' end. The presence of a dG overhang quenches the fluorescence less efficiently than a blunt end dG-dC or dC-dG base pair. When located internally in the double strand, the dG-dC base pair does not affect the fluorescence of the nearby dye. Guanosine in a single-stranded oligonucleotide quenches the fluorescence of nearby dye by <2-fold. Upon duplex formation, this quenching is eliminated and the fluorescence increases. This increase can only be detected when the fluorophore is located at least 6 nt from the terminal dG-dC base pair. The change of fluorescence polarization upon duplex formation inversely correlates with the change of intensity. Fluorescein conjugated to a single-stranded oligonucleotide or a duplex undergoes a bi-exponential decay with approximately 4 and approximately 1 ns lifetimes.},

For a more detailed structural interpretation of single-molecule FRET assays, information about the positions as well as the dynamics of the dye labels attached to the biomolecule is important. In this work, Rhodamine 6G (2-[3'-(ethylamino)-6'-(ethylimino)-2',7'-dimethyl-6'H-xanthen-9'-yl]-benzoic acid) bound to the 5'-end of a 20 base pair long DNA duplex is investigated by both single-molecule multiparameter fluorescence detection (MFD) experiments and NMR spectroscopy. Rhodamine 6G is commonly employed in nucleic acid research as a FRET dye. MFD experiments directly reveal the equilibrium of the dye bound to DNA between three heterogeneous environments, which are characterized by distinct fluorescence lifetime and intensity distributions as a result of different guanine-dye excited-state electron transfer interactions. Sub-ensemble fluorescence autocorrelation analysis shows the highly dynamic character of the dye-DNA interactions ranging from nano- to milliseconds and species-specific triplet relaxation times. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy corroborates this information by the determination of the detailed geometric structures of the dye-nucleobase complex and their assignment to each population observed in the single-molecule fluorescence experiments. From both methods, a consistent and detailed molecular description of the structural and dynamical heterogeneity is obtained.},

This algorithm is tested extensively on simulations and simple experimental systems.

A series of target oligonucleotides, each with a unique 3' overhang (4 bases), was hybridised to either 5' fluorescein (FAM)- or Alexa-488-labelled probes, and the changes in fluorescence properties were monitored. We found that the number of guanine bases in the overhang region of the target oligonucleotides was proportional to the amount of fluorescence quenching observed for both the FAM and Alexa-488 dyes. FAM appeared to be more sensitive to guanine-induced quenching with three and four guanine bases resulting in greater than a twofold decrease in the quantum yield of the fluorophore compared to the no-overhang target. In addition, we found that adenine bases caused fluorescence quenching of the Alexa-488-labelled probe, whereas the FAM-labelled probe appeared insensitive. The quenching data, generated with the steady-state fluorescence measurements, displayed a linear correlation with that obtained using a fluorescent thermal cycler, suggesting the applicability to real-time PCR measurements. Anisotropy data from the series of duplexes correlated with the fluorescence quantum yield, suggesting that quenching was accompanied by increased dye mobility.},

Fluorescein and Cy3 are an important donor-acceptor pair of fluorophores; the characteristic Forster length for this pair on DNA is 56 A, so the pair can be used to study relatively long distances. Measurement of FRET efficiency for a series of DNA duplexes terminally labeled with fluorescein and Cy3 suggests that the Cy3 is close to the helical axis of the DNA. An NMR analysis of a self-complementary DNA duplex 5'-labeled with Cy3 shows that the fluorophore is stacked onto the end of the helix, in a manner similar to that of an additional base pair. This provides a known point from which distances calculated from FRET measurements are measured. Using the FRET efficiencies for the series of DNA duplexes as restraints, we have determined an effective position for the fluorescein, which is maximally extended laterally from the helix. The knowledge of the fluorophore positions can now be used for more precise interpretation of FRET data from nucleic acids.},

   Abstract = {Sequential arrays of chromophores at regulated distances were constructed on a noncovalent DNA molecular assembly system in aqueous media. Photoinduced fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) behaviors were then observed. We designed a number of chromophore/oligo-DNA conjugates with varying sequences. The chromophores eosin (Eo), TexasRed (TR), and tetramethylrhodamine (Rho) were employed as the energy donor, acceptor, and mediator, respectively, based on overlapping excitation and emission spectra. The chromophores were attached via aminolinkers to the 5'-terminals of 10mer oligo-DNAs consisting of AT rich sequences. The arrangement of Eo-Rho or Rho-TR with 10-residue (1 pitch of duplex) distances was ensured by duplex formation of the conjugates with a 20mer matrix oligo-DNA composed of complementary sequences to the conjugates. Single-step FRET from Eo to Rho and from Rho to TR was confirmed on the duplex. The three chromophore conjugates were then mixed with longer matrix oligo-DNAs (30 or 40mer) consisting of complementary sequences to the conjugates, producing Eo-(Rho)(n)-TR (n = 1 or 2) arrays with 10-residue distances. Multistep FRET from Eo to TR through the Rho mediator(s) was observed on the molecular assemblies. This photoenergy transmission system offers a good model for a photoenergy transmission system mimicking photosynthetic systems.},

   Abstract = {Cyanine fluorophores are commonly used in single-molecule FRET experiments with nucleic acids. We have previously shown that indocarbocyanine fluorophores attached to the 5'-termini of DNA and RNA via three-carbon atom linkers stack on the ends of the helix, orienting their transition moments. We now investigate the orientation of sulfoindocarbocyanine fluorophores tethered to the 5'-termini of DNA via 13-atom linkers. Fluorescence lifetime measurements of sulfoindocarbocyanine 3 attached to double-stranded DNA indicate that the fluorophore is extensively stacked onto the terminal basepair at 15 degrees C, with properties that depend on the terminal sequence. In single molecules of duplex DNA, FRET efficiency between sulfoindocarbocyanine 3 and 5 attached in this manner is modulated with helix length, indicative of fluorophore orientation and consistent with stacked fluorophores that can undergo lateral motion. We conclude that terminal stacking is an intrinsic property of the cyanine fluorophores irrespective of the length of the tether and the presence or absence of sulfonyl groups. However, compared to short-tether indocarbocyanine, the mean rotational relationship between the two fluorophores is changed by approximately 60 degrees for the long-tether sulfoindocarbocyanine fluorophores. This is consistent with the transition moments becoming approximately aligned with the long axis of the terminal basepair for the long-linker species.},

The dodecamer d[CGCA(Ap)ATTTGCG]2 was investigated, and we also examined the effect of a specific minor groove-binding drug, pentamidine, on hydration dynamics. Two time scales were observed: approximately 1 ps (bulk-like) and 10-12 ps (weakly bound type), consistent with layer hydration observed in proteins and DNA. However, for denatured DNA, the cosolvent condition of 40% formamide hydration is very different: it becomes that of bulk (in the presence of formamide). Well known electron transfer between Ap and nearby bases in stacked assemblies becomes inefficient in the single-stranded state. The rigidity of Ap in the single strands is significantly higher than that in bulk water and that attached to deoxyribose, suggesting a unique role for the dynamics of the phosphate-sugar-base in helix formation. The disparity in minor and major groove hydration is evident because of the site selection of Ap and in the time scale observed here (in the presence and absence of the drug), which is different by a factor of 2 from that observed in the minor groove-drug recognition.},

   Abstract = {A 16-mer deoxyribonucleotide was labeled at the 5'-end with x-rhodamine and at the 3'-end with fluorescein. Forster resonance energy transfer was used to determine the distribution, P(R), of donor-acceptor distances for the oligomer in three duplex structures (hybridized to complementary strands having 10, 16, and 24 bases) and as a single strand; measurements were made in 0.18 M NaCl and 1 M KCl solutions. These distributions were derived from lifetime measurements made in the frequency domain using a multiharmonic frequency phase fluorometer. The fluorescein fluorescence decay for each duplex structure was fit very well with P(R) modeled as a shifted Gaussian. On the basis of the mean donor-acceptor distance, these structures for the 16-mer and the 24-mer were consistent with that of B-DNA. For the 16-mer duplex in 0.18 M NaCl, the distribution was centered at 68.4 A with sigma = 6.4 A. For the 10-mer duplex, the mean donor-acceptor distance, 61.8 A, is much larger than that for a structure with the fluorophores extended perpendicular to the helix axis. For the single-strand data, various high-quality fits yielded physically unreasonable distributions or could not accurately account for the acceptor response. Considered analyses suggested that the single-strand distribution was best represented by a shifted Gaussian, with R = 51.5 A and sigma = 10.0 A in 0.18 M NaCl. In all cases, sigma increased and R decreased in 1 M KCl relative to their values in 0.18 M NaCl, consistent with the increased flexibility of the polymer.},

   Abstract = {Time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer (trFRET) has been used to obtain interdye distance distributions. These distributions give the most probable distance as well as a parameter, sigma, that characterize the width of the distribution. This latter parameter contains information not only on the flexibility of the dyes tethered to macromolecules, but on the flexibility of the macromolecules. Both the most probable interdye distance as well as sigma provide insight into DNA static bending and DNA flexibility. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy and static anisotropy measurements can be combined to provide a measure of the cone angle within which the tethered dyes appear to wobble. When this motion is an order of magnitude faster than the average lifetime that characterizes transfer, an average value of the dipolar orientational parameter kappa2 can be calculated for various mutual dye orientations. The resulting kappa2 distribution is very much narrower than the limiting values of 0 and 4, allowing more precise distances and distance changes to be determined. Static and time-resolved fluorescence data can be combined to constrain the analyses of DNA-protein kinetics to provide thermodynamic parameters for binding and for conformational changes along a reaction coordinate. The parameter sigma can be used to model multiple DNA-protein complexes with varying DNA bend angles in a global fitting of trFRET data. Such a global fitting approach has shown how the range of bends in single base DNA variants, when bound by the TATA binding protein (TBP), can be understood in terms of two limiting forms. Time-resolved FRET, combined with steady-state FRET, can be used to show not only how osmolytes affect the binding of DNA to proteins, but also how DNA bending depends on osmolyte concentration in the DNA-protein complexes.},

Conversely, gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) are known for their capacity to induce strong fluorescence quenching of conventional dye donors. Using a rigid variable-length polypeptide as a bifunctional biological linker, we monitor the photoluminescence quenching of CdSe-ZnS QDs by Au-NP acceptors arrayed around the QD surface, where the center-to-center separation distance was varied over a broad range of values (approximately 50-200 Angstrom). We measure the Au-NP-induced quenching rates for such QD conjugates using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements and examine the results within the context of theoretical treatments based on the Forster dipole-dipole resonance energy transfer, dipole-metal particle energy transfer, and nanosurface energy transfer. Our results indicate that nonradiative quenching of the QD emission by proximal Au-NPs is due to long-distance dipole-metal interactions that extend significantly beyond the classical Forster range, in agreement with previous studies using organic dye-Au-NP donor-acceptor pairs.},

   Abstract = {The fluorescent nucleobase analogues of the tricyclic cytosine (tC) family, tC and tC(O), possess high fluorescence quantum yields and single fluorescence lifetimes, even after incorporation into double-stranded DNA, which make these base analogues particularly useful as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes. Recently, we reported the first all-nucleobase FRET pair consisting of tC(O) as the donor and the novel tC(nitro) as the acceptor. The rigid and well-defined position of this FRET pair inside the DNA double helix, and consequently excellent control of the orientation factor in the FRET efficiency, are very promising features for future studies of nucleic acid structures. Here, we provide the necessary spectroscopic and photophysical characterization of tC(nitro) needed in order to utilize this probe as a FRET acceptor in nucleic acids. The lowest energy absorption band from 375 to 525 nm is shown to be the result of a single in-plane polarized electronic transition oriented approximately 27 degrees from the molecular long axis. This band overlaps the emission bands of both tC and tC(O), and the Forster characteristics of these donor-acceptor pairs are calculated for double-stranded DNA scenarios. In addition, the UV-vis absorption of tC(nitro) is monitored in a broad pH range and the neutral form is found to be totally predominant under physiological conditions with a pK(a) of 11.1. The structure and electronic spectrum of tC(nitro) is further characterized by density functional theory calculations.},

   Abstract = {Fundamental insight into the unique fluorescence and nucleobase-mimicking properties of the fluorescent nucleobase analogues of the tC family is not only vital in explaining the behaviour of these probes in nucleic acid environments, but will also be profitable in the development of new and improved fluorescent base analogues. Here, temperature-dependent fluorescence quantum yield measurements are used to successfully separate and quantify the temperature-dependent and temperature-independent non-radiative excited-state decay processes of the three nucleobase analogues tC, tC(O) and tC(nitro); all of which are derivatives of a phenothiazine or phenoxazine tricyclic framework. These results strongly suggest that the non-radiative decay process dominating the fast deactivation of tC(nitro) is an internal conversion of a different origin than the decay pathways of tC and tC(O). tC(nitro) is reported to be fluorescent only in less dipolar solvents at room temperature, which is explained by an increase in excited-state dipole moment along the main non-radiative decay pathway, a suggestion that applies in the photophysical discussion of large polycyclic nitroaromatics in general. New insight into the ground and excited-state potential energy surfaces of the isolated tC bases is obtained by means of high level DFT and TDDFT calculations. The S(0) potential energy surfaces of tC and tC(nitro) possess two global minima corresponding to geometries folded along the middle sulfur-nitrogen axis separated by an energy barrier of 0.05 eV as calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level. The ground-state potential energy surface of tC(O) is also predicted to be shallow along the bending coordinate but with an equilibrium geometry corresponding to the planar conformation of the tricyclic framework, which may explain some of the dissimilar properties of tC and tC(O) in various confined (biological) environments. The S(1) equilibrium geometries of all three base analogues are predicted to be planar. These results are discussed in the context of the tC bases positioned in double-stranded DNA scenarios.},

Correlating the internitroxide distance to the geometry of the parent molecule requires computational analysis of the label conformers. Here, we report sixteen 4-ns MD simulations on a DNA duplex d(CTACTGCTTTAG) .d(CTAAAGCAGTAG) with label pairs at C7/C19, T5/A17, and T2/T14, respectively. For each labeled duplex, four simulations were performed with S(P)/S(P), R(P)/R(P), S(P)/R(P), and R(P)/S(P) labels, with initial all trans label conformations. Another set of four simulations was performed for the 7/19-labeled duplex using a different label starting conformation. The average internitroxide distance r(MD) was within 0.2 A for the two sets of simulations for the 7/19-labeled duplex, indicating sufficient sampling of conformational space. For all three labeled duplexes studied, r(MD) agreed with experimental values, as well as with average distances obtained from an efficient conformer search algorithm (NASNOX). The simulations also showed that the labels have conformational preferences determined by the linker chemistry and label-DNA interactions. These results establish computational algorithms that allow use of the 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline label for mapping global structures of nucleic acids.},

Rotational rigidity also prevents undesirable dye-DNA interactions, which have been shown to affect the photophysical properties of the dye. Unusually large FRET efficiencies for donor-acceptor pairs separated by 102 A (three helical turns) were measured and attributed to the favorable relative orientation of the dipoles. The same FRET efficiency was measured for a sample in which the donor-acceptor separation was 12 A shorter, demonstrating the important role of relative orientation in FRET experiments.},

   Abstract = {The SF1 DNA helicases are multi-domain proteins that can unwind duplex DNA in reactions that are coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis. Crystal structures of two such helicases, Escherichia coli Rep and Bacillus stearothermophilus PcrA, show that the 2B sub-domain of these proteins can be found in dramatically different orientations (closed versus open) with respect to the remainder of the protein, suggesting that the 2B domain is highly flexible. By systematically using fluorescence resonance energy transfer at the single-molecule level, we have determined both the orientation of an E.coli Rep monomer bound to a 3'-single-stranded-double-stranded (ss/ds) DNA junction in solution, as well as the relative orientation of its 2B sub-domain. To accomplish this, we developed a highly efficient procedure for site-specific fluorescence labeling of Rep and a bio-friendly immobilization scheme, which preserves its activities. Both ensemble and single-molecule experiments were carried out, although the single-molecule experiments proved to be essential here in providing quantitative distance information that could not be obtained by steady-state ensemble measurements. Using distance-constrained triangulation procedures we demonstrate that in solution the 2B sub-domain of a Rep monomer is primarily in the "closed" conformation when bound to a 3'-ss/ds DNA, similar to the orientation observed in the complex of PcrA bound to a 3'-ss/ds DNA. Previous biochemical studies have shown that a Rep monomer bound to such a 3'-ss/ds DNA substrate is unable to unwind the DNA and that a Rep oligomer is required for helicase activity. Therefore, the closed form of Rep bound to a partial duplex DNA appears to be an inhibited form of the enzyme.},

   Abstract = {Pairs of Au nanoparticles have recently been proposed as "plasmon rulers" based on the dependence of their light scattering on the interparticle distance. Preliminary work has suggested that plasmon rulers can be used to measure and monitor dynamic distance changes over the 1- to 100-nm length scale in biology. Here, we substantiate that plasmon rulers can be used to measure dynamical biophysical processes by applying the ruler to a system that has been investigated extensively by using ensemble kinetic measurements: the cleavage of DNA by the restriction enzyme EcoRV. Temporal resolutions of up to 240 Hz were obtained, and the end-to-end extension of up to 1,000 individual dsDNA enzyme substrates could be simultaneously monitored for hours. The kinetic parameters extracted from our single-molecule cleavage trajectories agree well with values obtained in bulk through other methods and confirm well known features of the cleavage process, such as DNA bending before cleavage.

The unlimited lifetime, high temporal resolution, and high signal/noise ratio make the plasmon ruler a unique tool for studying macromolecular assemblies and conformational changes at the single-molecule level.},

Plasmon rulers utilize the distance dependence of the plasmon coupling between individual noble metal particles to measure distances. Although the plasmon ruler approach is still an emerging technology, proof-of-principle experiments have demonstrated that plasmon rulers can already be used to investigate structural fluctuations in nucleoprotein complexes, monitor nuclease catalyzed DNA or RNA cleavage reactions, and detect DNA bending. The physical concepts underlying plasmon rulers are summarized, and effective assembly approaches as well as recent applications are discussed. Plasmon rulers are a useful addition to the single molecule biophysics toolbox, since they allow single biomolecules to be continuously monitored for days at high temporal resolutions.},

The major uncertainty originates from the unknown orientation between the optical dipole moments of the fluorescent markers, especially when the molecule undergoes thermal fluctuations in physiological conditions. We introduce a statistical method based on the von Mises-Fisher distribution for the interpretation of fluorescence decay dynamics in donor-acceptor FRET pairs that allows us to retrieve both the orientation and the extent of directional fluctuations of the involved dipole moments. We verify the method by applying it to donor-acceptor pairs controllably attached to DNA helices and find that common assumptions such as complete rotational freedom or fully hindered rotation of the dipoles fail a physical interpretation of the fluorescence decay dynamics. This methodology is applicable in single-molecule and ensemble measurements of FRET to derive more accurate distance estimates from optical experiments, without the need for more complex and expensive NMR studies.},

Double-stranded oligonucleotides were chemically labeled with donor and acceptor resonance energy transfer probes at each end for distance determinations. These measurements were made independently using a terbium chelate as a donor to each of four chemically and spectroscopically distinct acceptor probes from the xanthene and cyanine dye groups. The choice of acceptor significantly affected the separation distance measured. Conformational searching algorithms on the atomic model corrected for the differences to within 0.2 nm on average. Verifying its usefulness on proteins, the localized conformational searching method determined the orientation of a fluorescent probe on RNase A that corresponds closely to available crystallographic models of the labeled protein (RMS deviation = 0.1 nm). Also, analysis of the symmetry of the fluorophores' structures suggests why FRET orientation factors are often closer to their dynamic average value than might normally be expected. Furthermore, the computational method provides insights about FRET data that are important for assessing the stability of the alpha-helix separating the SH1 and SH2 reactive thiols in skeletal myosin.},

This species did not incorporate nucleotides and is structurally distinct from the other two observed species. We determined that the nucleic acid substrate is bound at a site far removed from the nucleic acid-binding tract observed by crystallography. In contrast, the other two states are identified as being similar to the x-ray crystal structure and represent distinct enzymatically productive stages in DNA polymerization. These species differ by only a 5-A shift in the position of the nucleic acid. Addition of nucleoside triphosphate or of inorganic pyrophosphate allowed us to assign them as the educt and product state in the polymerization reaction cycle; i.e., the educt state is a complex in which the nucleic acid is positioned to allow nucleotide incorporation. The second RT:nucleic acid complex is the product state, which is formed immediately after nucleotide incorporation, but before RT translates to the next nucleotide.},

   Abstract = {Single-stranded DNA generated in the cell during DNA metabolism is stabilized and protected by binding of ssDNA-binding (SSB) proteins. Escherichia coli SSB, a representative homotetrameric SSB, binds to ssDNA by wrapping the DNA using its four subunits. However, such a tightly wrapped, high-affinity protein-DNA complex still needs to be removed or repositioned quickly for unhindered action of other proteins. Here we show, using single-molecule two- and three-colour fluorescence resonance energy transfer, that tetrameric SSB can spontaneously migrate along ssDNA. Diffusional migration of SSB helps in the local displacement of SSB by an elongating RecA filament. SSB diffusion also melts short DNA hairpins transiently and stimulates RecA filament elongation on DNA with secondary structure. This observation of diffusional movement of a protein on ssDNA introduces a new model for how an SSB protein can be redistributed, while remaining tightly bound to ssDNA during recombination and repair processes.},

   Abstract = {RNase P catalyzes the 5' maturation of transfer RNA (tRNA). RNase P from Bacillus subtilis comprises a large RNA component (130 kDa, P RNA) and a small protein subunit (14 kDa, P protein). Although P RNA alone can efficiently catalyze the maturation reaction in vitro, P protein is strictly required under physiological conditions. We have used time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer on a series of donor-labeled substrates and two acceptor-labeled P proteins to determine the conformation of the pre-tRNA 5' leader relative to the protein in the holoenzyme-pre-tRNA complex. The resulting distance distribution measurements indicate that the leader binds to the holoenzyme in an extended conformation between nucleotides 3 and 7. The conformational mobility of nucleotides 5-8 in the leader is reduced, providing further evidence that these nucleotides interact with the holoenzyme. The increased fluorescence intensity and lifetime of the 5'-fluorescein label of these leaders indicate a more hydrophobic environment, consistent with the notion that such interactions occur with the central cleft of the P protein. Taken together, our data support a model where the P protein binds to the 5' leader between the fourth and seventh nucleotides upstream of the cleavage site, extending the leader and decreasing its structural dynamics. Thus, P protein acts as a wedge to separate the 5' from the 3' terminus of the pre-tRNA and to position the cleavage site in the catalytic core. These results reveal a structural basis for the P protein dependent discrimination between precursor and mature tRNAs.},

   Abstract = {The hammerhead ribozyme is one of the best-studied small RNA enzymes, yet is mechanistically still poorly understood. We measured the Mg(2+) dependencies of folding and catalysis for two distinct hammerhead ribozymes, HHL and HH alpha. HHL has three long helical stems and was previously used to characterize Mg(2+)-induced folding. HH alpha has shorter stems and an A.U tandem next to the cleavage site that increases activity approximately 10-fold at 10 mM Mg(2+). We find that both ribozymes cleave with fast rates (5-10 min(-1), at pH 8 and 25 degrees C) at nonphysiologically high Mg(2+) concentrations, but with distinct Mg(2+) dissociation constants for catalysis: 90 mM for HHL and 10 mM for HH alpha. Using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we measured the stem I-stem II distance distribution as a function of Mg(2+) concentration, in the presence and absence of 100 mM Na(+), at 4 and 25 degrees C. Our data show two structural transitions. The larger transition (with Mg(2+) dissociation constants in the physiological range of approximately 1 mM, below the catalytic dissociation constants) brings stems I and II close together and is hindered by Na(+). The second, globally minor, rearrangement coincides with catalytic activation and is not hindered by Na(+). Additionally, the more active HH alpha exhibits a higher flexibility than HHL under all conditions. Finally, both ribozyme-product complexes have a bimodal stem I-stem II distance distribution, suggesting a fast equilibrium between distinct conformers. We propose that the role of diffusely bound Mg(2+) is to increase the probability of formation of a properly aligned catalytic core, thus compensating for the absence of naturally occurring kissing-loop interactions.},

This blinking is observed when directly exciting Cy5 with 640 nm light and by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). We find that Cy5 blinking is influenced by the proximity of the donor, the structure of the donor, the presence of 514 nm excitation, and FRET. In the context of single-molecule FRET, blinking of the acceptor produces anticorrelated donor-acceptor intensity fluctuations, which can be difficult to discern from variations in the interdye distance. Slow blinking is, in particular, problematic because it overlaps with biologically relevant time scales. By employing an alternating 514640 nm laser excitation scheme, we show that the dark states can be readily resolved and discriminated from FRET distance fluctuations.},

B-DNA was used as a scaffold to position the donor (Cy3 or TMR) at precise distances from the acceptor (Cy5) within the Forster radius. We found that the variation in the Cy3 quantum yield is approximately 5 times larger than that of TMR. By taking into account the molecule-to-molecule variability in the acceptor/donor quantum yield ratio, the apparent fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiencies were scaled to yield the theoretical values.

   Abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the amino acid tryptophan (Trp) as donor and a 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene-labeled asparagine (Dbo) as acceptor in peptides of the general structure Trp-(Pro)n-Dbo-NH2 (n = 1-6) was investigated by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence, CD, and NMR spectroscopy as well as by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (GROMOS96 force field). The Trp/Dbo FRET pair is characterized by a very short Forster radius (R0 ca. 9 A), which allowed distance determinations in such short peptides. Water and propylene glycol were investigated as solvents. The peptides were designed to show an early nucleation of the poly(Pro)II (PPII) secondary helix structure for n > or = 2, which was confirmed by their CD spectra. The shortest peptide (n = 1) adopts preferentially the trans conformation about the Trp-Pro bond, as confirmed by NMR spectra. The FRET efficiencies ranged 2-72% and were found to depend sensitively on the peptide length, i.e., the number of intervening proline residues. The analysis of the FRET data at different levels of theory (assuming either a fixed distance or distance distributions according to a wormlike chain or Gaussian model) afforded donor-acceptor distances between ca. 8 A (n = 1) and ca. 16 A (n = 6) in water, which were found to be similar or slightly higher in propylene glycol. The distances afforded by the Trp/Dbo FRET pair were found to be reasonable in comparison to literature data, expectations from the PPII helix structure, and the results from MD simulations. The persistence lengths for the longer peptides were found to lie at 30-70 A in water and 220 +/- 40 A in propylene glycol, suggesting a more rigid PPII helical structure in propylene glycol. A detailed comparison with literature data on FRET in polyprolines demonstrates that the donor-acceptor distances extracted by FRET are correlated with the Forster radii of the employed FRET pairs. This demonstrates the limitations of using FRET as a spectroscopic ruler for short polyprolines, which is presumably due to the breakdown of the point dipole approximation in Forster theory, when the size of the chromophores becomes comparable or larger than the distances under investigation.},

   Abstract = {The elegant theory developed by Forster to describe the rate of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and an acceptor has played a key role in understanding the structure and dynamics of polymers, biopolymers (proteins, nucleic acids), and self-assemblies (photosystems, micellar systems). Forster theory assumes the transition charge densities of donor and acceptor molecules are point dipoles and hence predicts a 1/R(6) dependence of energy transfer rate on center-to-center separation distance, R. In addition, a preaveraging over the orientations of the two dipoles is usually performed. The present review examines the validity of these assumptions in following different donor-acceptor (D-A) systems: (i) dye molecules attached to a flexible polymer chain in solution, (ii) extended conjugated dye molecules in quenched conformation, (iii) dye and a spherical metal nanoparticle of different sizes, (iv) two spherical metal nanoparticles, and (v) two prolate shaped metal nanoparticles at different relative orientations. In the case of dye molecules attached to a flexible polymer chain, we discuss the recent theoretical and computer simulation studies of energy transfer dynamics. It includes an analysis of Wilemski-Fixman (WF) theory of a bimolecular reaction in solution, applied to the excitation energy transfer between two ends of the polymer. We briefly describe the limitation of the WF theory and its generalizations that lead to a better agreement between the theory and the simulation results. The orientational dynamics of dye molecules is found to significantly influence the rate of excitation energy transfer, and may play a "hidden role" in influencing the observed distance dependence. For extended conjugated D-A systems and those involving nonspherical metal nanoparticles, even at intermediate separations, a significant deviation from 1/R(6)-type distance dependence of the energy transfer rate is found. Surprisingly, however, this distance dependence is robust for D-A systems involving spherical metal nanoparticles. For both spherical and nonspherical metal nanoparticles (MNps), the functional dependence of rate on the surface-to-surface separation distance (d) is quite different, at small to intermediate distances (compared to the size of the MNps). The rate calculations of excitation energy transfer between extended conjugated dye molecules reveal that optically dark states can significantly contribute toward enhancing the energy transfer rate. It is further found that the rate of energy transfer between nonspherical metal nanoparticles exhibits an interesting orientation dependence not anticipated in Forster's approach.},

   Abstract = {The sulfoindocyanine Cy3 is one of the most commonly used fluorescent dyes in the investigation of the structure and dynamics of nucleic acids by means of fluorescence methods. In this work, we report the fluorescence and photophysical properties of Cy3 attached covalently to single-stranded and duplex DNA. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques were used to determine fluorescence quantum yields, emission lifetimes, and fluorescence anisotropy decays. The existence of a transient photoisomer was investigated by means of transient absorption techniques. The fluorescence quantum yield of Cy3 is highest when attached to the 5' terminus of single-stranded DNA (Cy3-5' ssDNA), and decreases by a factor of 2.4 when the complementary strand is annealed to form duplex DNA (Cy3-5' dsDNA). Substantial differences were also observed between the 5'-modified strands and strands modified through an internal amino-modified deoxy uridine. The fluorescence decay of Cy3 became multiexponential upon conjugation to DNA. The longest lifetime was observed for Cy3-5' ssDNA, where about 50% of the decay is dominated by a 2.0-ns lifetime. This value is more than 10 times larger than the fluorescence lifetime of the free dye in solution. These observations are interpreted in terms of a model where the molecule undergoes a trans-cis isomerization reaction from the first excited state. We observed that the activation energy for photoisomerization depends strongly on the microenvironment in which the dye is located. The unusually high activation energy measured for Cy3-5' ssDNA is an indication of dye-ssDNA interactions. In fact, the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay of this sample is dominated by a 2.5-ns rotational correlation time, which evidences the lack of rotational freedom of the dye around the linker that separates it from the terminal 5' phosphate. The remarkable variations in the photophysical properties of Cy3-DNA constructs demonstrate that caution should be used when Cy3 is used in studies employing DNA conjugates.},

The lowest energy absorption band at 360 nm (epsilon = 9000 M(-1) cm(-1)) is dominated by a single in-plane polarized electronic transition and the fluorescence, centred at 465 nm, has a quantum yield of 0.3. When incorporated into double-stranded DNA, tC(O) shows only minor variations in fluorescence intensity and lifetime with neighbouring bases, and the average quantum yield is 0.22. These features make tC(O), on average, the brightest DNA-incorporated base analogue so far reported. Furthermore, it base pairs exclusively with guanine and causes minimal perturbations to the native structure of DNA. These properties make tC(O) a promising base analogue that is perfectly suited for e.g. photophysical studies of DNA interacting with macromolecules (proteins) or for determining size and shape of DNA tertiary structures using techniques such as fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).},

As the size of DNA nanostructures are becoming increasingly smaller, commonly used methods for characterization like atomic force microscopy (AFM) will become increasingly more difficult. Here we demonstrate that time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (tr-FRET) can serve as a tool for retrieving structural information on small DNA nanostructures. We have formed a DNA pseudohexagon using six different standard 22-mer oligonucleotides. The construct was labeled with a donor (fluorescein) in one corner while "walking" the acceptor (Cy3) from corner to corner around the hexagon. This resulted in five differently labeled constructs that were investigated with time-correlated single photon counting. The distribution of donor-acceptor distances present in each sample was estimated from analyzing the donor emission decays using a Gaussian distribution model. The results show a relatively wide distribution for all measured distances, fwhm between 14 and 33 angstrom, indicating that the pseudohexagonal motif is a flexible structure. In addition the recovered mean distances between the donor and acceptor follow the expected theoretical trend very well. The results show that, not only is tr-FRET ail alternative method for retrieving structural information from DNA nanostructures whose size are below the present resolution of AFM but also, it demonstrate the potential of tr-FRET as a method for probing local flexibility in larger arrays of this kind.},

The fluorescence lifetimes increase when going from tC free in solution (3.2 ns) to single- and double-stranded DNA (on average 5.7 and 6.3 ns, respectively). The mono-exponential decays further support previous NMR results where it was found that tC has a well-defined position and geometry within the DNA helix. Furthermore, we find that the oxidation potential of tC is 0.4 V lower than for deoxyguanosine, the natural base with the lowest oxidation potential. This suggests that tC may be of interest in charge transfer studies in DNA as an electron hole acceptor. We also present a novel synthetic route to the phosphoramidite form of tC. The results presented here together with previous work show that tC is a very good C-analogue that induces minimal perturbation to the native structure of DNA. This makes tC unique as a fluorescent base analogue and is thus highly interesting in a range of applications for studying e.g. structure, dynamics and kinetics in nucleic acid systems.},

   Abstract = {Probability distribution analysis (PDA) is a recently developed statistical tool for predicting the shapes of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) histograms, which allows the identification of single or multiple static molecular species within a single histogram. We used a generalized PDA method to predict the shapes of FRET histograms for molecules interconverting dynamically between multiple states. This method is tested on a series of model systems, including both static DNA fragments and dynamic DNA hairpins. By fitting the shape of this expected distribution to experimental data, the timescale of hairpin conformational fluctuations can be recovered, in good agreement with earlier published results obtained using different techniques. This method is also applied to studying the conformational fluctuations in the unliganded Klenow fragment (KF) of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, which allows both confirmation of the consistency of a simple, two-state kinetic model with the observed smFRET distribution of unliganded KF and extraction of a millisecond fluctuation timescale, in good agreement with rates reported elsewhere. We expect this method to be useful in extracting rates from processes exhibiting dynamic FRET, and in hypothesis-testing models of conformational dynamics against experimental data.},

The spin-labeling is accomplished during solid-phase synthesis of the oligonucleotides utilizing a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction between 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine and the rigid spin-label 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrrolin-1-yloxyl-3-acetylene (TPA). 4-Pulse electron double resonance (PELDOR) was then used to measure the intramolecular spin-spin distances via the dipolar coupling, yielding spin-spin distances of 19.2, 23.3, 34.7, 44.8, and 52.5 A. Employing a full-atom force field with explicit water, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations on the same spin-labeled oligonucleotides in their duplex B-form gave spin-spin distances of 19.6, 21.4, 33.0, 43.3, and 52.5 A, respectively, in very good agreement with the measured distances. This shows that the oligonucleotides adopt a B-form duplex structure also in frozen aqueous buffer solution. It also demonstrates that the combined use of site-directed spin-labeling, PELDOR experiments, and MD simulations can yield a microscopic picture about the overall structure of oligonucleotides. The technique is also applicable to more complex systems, like ribozymes or DNA/RNA-protein complexes, which are difficult to access by NMR or X-ray crystallography.},

They can be applied either at cryogenic or physiological temperatures and down to amounts of a few nanomoles. Spin centers may be metal ions, metal clusters, cofactor radicals, amino acid radicals, or spin labels.

   Abstract = {To determine whether Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements can provide quantitative distance information in single-molecule fluorescence experiments on polypeptides, we measured FRET efficiency distributions for donor and acceptor dyes attached to the ends of freely diffusing polyproline molecules of various lengths. The observed mean FRET efficiencies agree with those determined from ensemble lifetime measurements but differ considerably from the values expected from Forster theory, with polyproline treated as a rigid rod. At donor-acceptor distances much less than the Forster radius R(0), the observed efficiencies are lower than predicted, whereas at distances comparable to and greater than R(0), they are much higher. Two possible contributions to the former are incomplete orientational averaging during the donor lifetime and, because of the large size of the dyes, breakdown of the point-dipole approximation assumed in Forster theory. End-to-end distance distributions and correlation times obtained from Langevin molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the differences for the longer polyproline peptides can be explained by chain bending, which considerably shortens the donor-acceptor distances.},

The results are consistent with a Forster theory of energy transfer, provided the appropriate parameters are used. The use of lanthanide donors, in general, and this pair, in particular, has many advantages over more conventional FRET pairs, which rely solely on organic dyes. The distance at which 50% energy transfer occurs is large, 65 A; the donor lifetime is a single exponential and long (millisecond), making lifetime measurements facile and accurate. Uncertainty in the orientation factor, which creates uncertainty in measured distances, is minimized by the donor's multiple electronic transitions and long lifetime. The sensitized emission of the acceptor can be measured with little or no interfering background, yielding a > 25-fold improvements in the signal-to-background ratio over standard donor-acceptor pairs. These improvements are expected to make distances > 100 A measurable via FRET. We also report measurement of the sensitized emission lifetime, a measurement that is completely insensitive to total concentration and incomplete labeling.},

   Abstract = {Recognition of RNA by proteins and small molecules often involves large changes in RNA structure and dynamics, yet very few studies have so far characterized these motional changes. Here we extend to the protein-bound RNA recent 13C relaxation studies of motions in the RNA recognized by human U1A protein, a well-known model for protein-RNA recognition. Changes in relaxation observed upon complex formation demonstrate that the protein-binding site becomes rigid in the complex, but the upper stem-loop that defines the secondary structure of this RNA experiences unexpected motional freedom. By using a helix elongation strategy, we observe that the upper stem-loop moves independently of the remainder of the structure also in the absence of U1A. Surprisingly, RNA residues making important intermolecular contacts in the structure of the complex exhibit increased flexibility in the presence of the protein. Both of these results support the hypothesis that RNA-binding proteins select a structure that optimizes intermolecular contacts in the manifold of conformations sampled by the free RNA and that protein binding quenches these motions. Together with previous studies of the RNA-bound protein, they also demonstrate that protein-RNA interfaces experience complex motions that modulate the strength of individual interactions.},

Until now, however, very few studies have been dedicated to the systematic characterization of RNA motion and to their changes upon protein or small-molecule binding. The U1A protein-RNA complexes provide some of the best-studied examples of the role of RNA motional changes upon protein binding. Here, we report (13)C NMR relaxation studies of base and ribose dynamics for the RNA internal loop target of human U1A protein located within the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the mRNA coding for U1A itself. We also report the semi-quantitative analysis of both fast (nano- to picosecond) and intermediate (micro- to millisecond) motions for this paradigmatic RNA system. We measure (13)C T(1), T(1rho) and heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) for sugar and base nuclei, as well as the power dependence of T(1rho) at 500 MHz and 750 MHz, and analyze these results using the model-free formalism. The results provide a much clearer picture of the type of motions experienced by this RNA in the absence of the protein than was provided by the analysis of the structure based solely on NOEs and scalar couplings. They define a model where the RNA internal loop region "breathes" on a micro- to millisecond timescale with respect to the double-helical regions. Superimposed on this slower motion, the residues at the very tip of the loop undergo faster (nano- to picosecond) motions. We hypothesize that these motions allow the RNA to sample multiple conformations so that the protein can select a structure within the ensemble that optimizes intermolecular contacts.},

   Abstract = {In Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, the donor (D) and acceptor (A) fluorophores are usually attached to the macromolecule of interest via long flexible linkers of up to 15 A in length. This causes significant uncertainties in quantitative distance measurements and prevents experiments with short distances between the attachment points of the dyes due to possible dye-dye interactions. We present two approaches to overcome the above problems as demonstrated by FRET measurements for a series of dsDNA and dsRNA internally labeled with Alexa488 and Cy5 as D and A dye, respectively. First, we characterize the influence of linker length and flexibility on FRET for different dye linker types (long, intermediate, short) by analyzing fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy decays. For long linkers, we describe a straightforward procedure that allows for very high accuracy of FRET-based structure determination through proper consideration of the position distribution of the dye and of linker dynamics. The position distribution can be quickly calculated with geometric accessible volume (AV) simulations, provided that the local structure of RNA or DNA in the proximity of the dye is known and that the dye diffuses freely in the sterically allowed space. The AV approach provides results similar to molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and is fully consistent with experimental FRET data. In a benchmark study for ds A-RNA, an rmsd value of 1.3 A is achieved. Considering the case of undefined dye environments or very short DA distances, we introduce short linkers with a propargyl or alkenyl unit for internal labeling of nucleic acids to minimize position uncertainties. Studies by ensemble time correlated single photon counting and single-molecule detection show that the nature of the linker strongly affects the radius of the dye's accessible volume (6-16 A). For short propargyl linkers, heterogeneous dye environments are observed on the millisecond time scale. A detailed analysis of possible orientation effects (kappa(2) problem) indicates that, for short linkers and unknown local environments, additional kappa(2)-related uncertainties are clearly outweighed by better defined dye positions.},

   Abstract = {For biomolecular applications, potential interactions between newly developed dye molecules and the biomolecule of interest can dramatically influence the accuracy of optical ruler techniques. By utilizing nanometal surface energy transfer (NSET), an optical technique is developed that allows the nature of interactions between dyes and a biomolecule, namely DNA, to be directly assessed. To demonstrate the method, interactions between well-known molecular dyes based on carboxyfluorescein (FAM, noninteracting) and Cy5 (known intercalator) with DNA is probed. The results demonstrate that FAM exhibits no interactions with the DNA backbone and is adequately represented as a solvent exposed dye, while the commonly used near-IR dye Cy5 exhibits two discrete interactions that depend on the site of appendage and the length of the linker arm. The exact population and nature of Cy5 interaction with the DNA indicates a 37% ratio of intercalation for the internal C(6), a 42% ratio for an internal C(3) spacer length, and no evidence of interaction for terminal labeling. The results allow quantitative assignment of the site occupation of donors to be analyzed providing a powerful set of information for use of dyes in FRET based optical ruler technologies without the need of single molecule methods or the assumption of an averaged site occupation for the donor.},

   Pages = {455-514},
   Abstract = {In the recent decade, single-molecule (sm) spectroscopy has come of age and is providing important insight into how biological molecules function. So far our view of protein function is formed, to a significant extent, by traditional structure determination showing many beautiful static protein structures. Recent experiments by single-molecule and other techniques have questioned the idea that proteins and other biomolecules are static structures. In particular, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies of single molecules have shown that biomolecules may adopt many conformations as they perform their function. Despite the success of sm-studies, interpretation of smFRET data are challenging since they can be complicated due to many artifacts arising from the complex photophysical behavior of fluorophores, dynamics, and motion of fluorophores, as well as from small amounts of contaminants. We demonstrate that the simultaneous acquisition of a maximum of fluorescence parameters by multiparameter fluorescence detection (MFD) allows for a robust assessment of all possible artifacts arising from smFRET and offers unsurpassed capabilities regarding the identification and analysis of individual species present in a population of molecules. After a short introduction, the data analysis procedure is described in detail together with some experimental considerations. The merits of MFD are highlighted further with the presentation of some applications to proteins and nucleic acids, including accurate structure determination based on FRET. A toolbox is introduced in order to demonstrate how complications originating from orientation, mobility, and position of fluorophores have to be taken into account when determining FRET-related distances with high accuracy. Furthermore, the broad time resolution (picoseconds to hours) of MFD allows for kinetic studies that resolve interconversion events between various subpopulations as a biomolecule of interest explores its structural energy landscape.},

The photobleaching behavior of free and bound fluorescein has also been investigated by experimental means. Both the theoretical simulation and experimental data show that photobleaching of fluorescein in microscopy is, in general, not a single-exponential process. The simulation suggests that the non-single-exponential behavior is caused by the oxygen-independent, proximity-induced triplet-triplet or triplet-ground state dye reactions of bound fluorescein in microscopy. The single-exponential process is a special case of photobleaching behavior when the reactions between the triplet dye and molecular oxygen are dominant.},

Noble metal nanoparticles have plasmon resonances in the visible range and do not blink or bleach. They have been employed as alternative probes to overcome the limitations of organic fluorophores, and the coupling of plasmons in nearby particles has been exploited to detect particle aggregation by a distinct color change in bulk experiments. Here we demonstrate that plasmon coupling can be used to monitor distances between single pairs of gold and silver nanoparticles. We followed the directed assembly of gold and silver nanoparticle dimers in real time and studied the kinetics of single DNA hybridization events. These "plasmon rulers" allowed us to continuously monitor separations of up to 70 nm for >3,000 s.},

   Abstract = {We provide a critical examination of two different methods for generating a donor-acceptor electronic coupling trajectory from a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory and three methods for sampling that coupling trajectory, allowing the modeling of experimental observables directly from the MD simulation. In the first coupling method we perform a single quantum-mechanical (QM) calculation to characterize the excited state behavior, specifically the transition dipole moment, of the fluorescent probe, which is then mapped onto the configuration space sampled by MD. We then utilize these transition dipoles within the ideal dipole approximation (IDA) to determine the electronic coupling between the probes that mediates the transfer of energy. In the second method we perform a QM calculation on each snapshot and use the complete transition densities to calculate the electronic coupling without need for the IDA. The resulting coupling trajectories are then sampled using three methods ranging from an independent sampling of each trajectory point (the independent snapshot method) to a Markov chain treatment that accounts for the dynamics of the coupling in determining effective rates. The results show that the IDA significantly overestimates the energy transfer rate (by a factor of 2.6) during the portions of the trajectory in which the probes are close to each other. Comparison of the sampling methods shows that the Markov chain approach yields more realistic observables at both high and low FRET efficiencies. Differences between the three sampling methods are discussed in terms of the different mechanisms for averaging over structural dynamics in the system. Convergence of the Markov chain method is carefully examined. Together, the methods for estimating coupling and for sampling the coupling provide a mechanism for directly connecting the structural dynamics modeled by MD with fluorescence observables determined through FRET experiments.},

The affinity of Cy3 for a T.A basepair (with the dye attached to T) was found to be significantly less than for the other basepairs. This was verified experimentally by measuring the activation energies for cis-trans isomerization of the dye. The simulation and experimental results indicate the existence of partially unstacked conformations amenable to photoisomerization. The simulations also showed that stacking of Cy3 straightens the DNA while stabilizing the first basepair. Our findings indicate that fluorescence is modulated by Cy3-DNA interactions in a sequence-dependent manner.},

   Abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has become a work-horse for distance measurements on the nanometer scale and between single molecules. Recent model systems for the FRET distance dependence such as polyprolines and dsDNA suffered from limited persistence lengths and sample heterogeneity. We designed a series of rigid DNA origami blocks where each block is labeled with one donor and one acceptor at distances ranging between 2.5 and 14 nm. Since all dyes are attached in one plane to the top surface of the origami block, static effects of linker lengths cancel out in contrast to commonly used dsDNA. We used single-molecule spectroscopy to compare the origami-based ruler to dsDNA and found that the origami blocks directly yield the expected distance dependence of energy transfer since the influence of the linkers on the donor-acceptor distance is significantly reduced. Based on a simple geometric model for the inter-dye distances on the origami block, the Forster radius R(0) could directly be determined from the distance dependence of energy transfer yielding R(0)=5.3+/-0.3 nm for the Cy3-Cy5 pair.},

Despite the importance of this process in polymerase fidelity, the precise nature of the molecular events involved remains unknown. Here we report a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system that monitors conformational changes of a polymerase-DNA complex during selection and binding of nucleotide substrates. This system utilizes the fluorescent base analogue 1,3-diaza-2-oxophenothiazine (tC) as the FRET donor and Alexa-555 (A555) as the acceptor. The tC donor was incorporated within a model DNA primer/template in place of a normal base, adjacent to the primer 3' terminus, while the A555 acceptor was attached to an engineered cysteine residue (C751) located in the fingers subdomain of the Klenow fragment (KF) polymerase. The FRET efficiency increased significantly following binding of a correct nucleotide substrate to the KF-DNA complex, showing that the fingers had closed over the active site. Fluorescence anisotropy titrations utilizing tC as a reporter indicated that the DNA was more tightly bound by the polymerase under these conditions, consistent with the formation of a closed ternary complex. The rate of the nucleotide-induced conformational transition, measured in stopped-flow FRET experiments, closely matched the rate of correct nucleotide incorporation, measured in rapid quench-flow experiments, indicating that the conformational change was the rate-limiting step in the overall cycle of nucleotide incorporation for the labeled KF-DNA system. Taken together, these results indicate that the FRET system can be used to probe enzyme conformational changes that are linked to the biochemical function of DNA polymerase.},

Labeling of the Tb(3+) chelate is accomplished via the linkage of a biotin-labeled DNA probe with the Tb(3+) chelate-labeled streptavidin. Strong sensitized emission of Cy3 was observed upon excitation of the Tb(3+) chelate at 325 nm, when the two probe DNAs were hybridized with the target DNA. The sensitivity of the assay was very high compared with those of the previous homogeneous-format assays using the conventional organic dyes; the detection limit of the present assay is about 30 pM of the target DNA strand.},

Triangulation of these distances using a metric matrix distance-geometry algorithm provided coordinates for these eight points. The resulting path for the protein-bound regulatory DNA, which fits well with the genetics, biochemistry, and X-ray crystal structures describing the individual proteins and their interactions with DNA, provides a new structural perspective into the molecular mechanism and regulation of the recombination reaction and illustrates a design by which different families of higher-order complexes can be assembled from different numbers and combinations of the same few proteins.},

   Abstract = {Theodor Forster would have been 100 years old this year, and he would have been astounded to see the impact of his scientific achievement, which is still evolving. Combining his quantitative approach of (Forster) resonance energy transfer (FRET) with state-of-the-art digital imaging techniques allows scientists to breach the resolution limits of light (ca. 200 nm) in light microscopy. The ability to deduce molecular or particle distances within a range of 1-10 nm in real time and to prove or disprove interactions between two or more components is of vital interest to researchers in many branches of science. While Forster's groundbreaking theory was published in the 1940s, the availability of suitable fluorophores, instruments, and analytical tools spawned numerous experiments in the last 20 years, as demonstrated by the exponential increase in publications. These cover basic investigation of cellular processes and the ability to investigate them when they go awry in pathological states, the dynamics involved in genetics, and following events in environmental sciences and methods in drug screening. This review covers the essentials of Theodor Forster's theory, describes the elements for successful implementation of FRET microscopy, the challenges and how to overcome them, and a leading-edge example of how Forster's scientific impact is still evolving in many directions. While this review cannot possibly do justice to the burgeoning field of FRET microscopy, a few interesting applications such as threecolor FRET, which greatly expands the opportunities for investigating interactions of cellular components compared with the traditional two-color method, are described, and an extensive list of references is provided for the interested reader to access.},

   Abstract = {In our previous report on resonance energy transfer from a dye molecule to graphene [J. Chem. Phys.129, 054703 (2008)], we had derived an expression for the rate of energy transfer from a dye to graphene. An integral in the expression for the rate was evaluated approximately. We found a Yuwaka-type dependence of the rate on the distance. We now present an exact evaluation of the integral involved, leading to very interesting results. For short distances (z<20 A), the present rate and the previous rate are in good agreement. For larger distances, the rate is found to have a z(-4) dependence on the distance, exactly. Thus we predict that for the case of pyrene on graphene, it is possible to observe fluorescence quenching up to a distance of 300 A. This is in sharp contrast to the traditional fluorescence resonance energy transfer where the quenching is observable only up to 100 A.},

Modifications to the basic method that are specific to smFRET are developed and tested on simulated systems. Use of the Haar wavelet basis produces the most optimally denoised estimates. We also assess various thresholding methods, develop a time-localized noise estimator, and implement a translation-invariant wavelet transformation to reduce artifacts associated with discontinuities and inadequate distinction of noise. The time-local estimator enhances noise reduction by 5-20%, and translation-invariant transformation nearly eliminates the aforementioned artifacts. Kinetic parameters extracted from denoised estimates are accurate to within 5% of the simulated values. Overall, the improved resolution results in the complete and accurate characterization of both simple and complex smFRET systems.},

Application of the method to experimental smFRET data shows that it distinguishes photoblinks from large shifts in smFRET efficiency while maintaining the important advantage of an unbiased approach. Known sources of experimental noise are examined and quantified as a means to remove their contributions via soft thresholding of wavelet coefficients. A wavelet decomposition algorithm is described, and thresholds are produced through the knowledge of noise parameters in the discrete-time photon signals. Reconstruction of the signals from thresholded coefficients produces signals that contain noise arising only from unquantifiable parameters. The method is applied to simulated and observed smFRET data, and it is found that the denoised data retain their underlying dynamic properties, but with increased resolution.},

   Abstract = {Among the advantages of the single-molecule approach when used to study biomolecular structural dynamics and interaction is its ability to distinguish between and independently observe minor subpopulations. In a single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and alternating laser excitation diffusion experiment, the various populations are apparent in the resultant histograms. However, because histograms are calculated based on the per-burst mean FRET and stoichiometry ratio and not on the internal photon distribution, much of the acquired information is lost, thereby reducing the capabilities of the method. Here we suggest what to our knowledge is a novel statistical analysis tool that significantly enhances these capabilities, and we use it to identify and isolate static and dynamic subpopulations. Based on a kernel density estimator and a proper photon distribution analysis, for each individual burst, we calculate scores that reflect properties of interest. Specifically, we determine the FRET efficiency and brightness ratio distributions and use them to reveal 1), the underlying structure of a two-state DNA-hairpin and a DNA hairpin that is bound to DNA origami; 2), a minor doubly labeled dsDNA subpopulation concealed in a larger singly labeled dsDNA; and 3), functioning DNA origami motors concealed within a larger subpopulation of defective motors. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach. The method was developed and tested using simulations, its rationality is described, and a computer algorithm is provided.},

   Abstract = {Histograms of single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency are often used to study the structures of biomolecules and relate these structures to function. Methods like probability distribution analysis analyze FRET histograms to detect heterogeneities in molecular structure, but they cannot determine whether this heterogeneity arises from dynamic processes or from the coexistence of several static structures. To this end, we introduce burst variance analysis (BVA), a method that detects dynamics by comparing the standard deviation of FRET from individual molecules over time to that expected from theory. Both simulations and experiments on DNA hairpins show that BVA can distinguish between static and dynamic sources of heterogeneity in single-molecule FRET histograms and can test models of dynamics against the observed standard deviation information. Using BVA, we analyzed the fingers-closing transition in the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and identified substantial dynamics in polymerase complexes formed prior to nucleotide incorporation; these dynamics may be important for the fidelity of DNA synthesis. We expect BVA to be broadly applicable to single-molecule FRET studies of molecular structure and to complement approaches such as probability distribution analysis and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy in studying molecular dynamics.},

We focused on the redox properties of some commercially available fluorescent dyes, and investigated dye-nucleotide interactions between a free dye and a nucleotide in aqueous solution by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques. Our results suggested that the quenching was accompanied by photoinduced electron transfer between a thermodynamically quenchable excited dye and a specific base. Several kinds of fluorescent dyes labeled to the 5'-end of oligonucleotide C10T6 were prepared, and their quenching ratios compared upon hybridization with the complementary oligonucleotide A6G10. The quenching was completely reversible and their efficiencies depended on the attached fluorophore types. The fluorescence of 5-FAM, BODIPY FL or TAMRA-modified probe was strongly quenched by hybridization.},

The TFIIB core domain is displaced from the Pol II wall, where it is located in the closed promoter complex.

   Abstract = {Molecular beacons have the potential to become a powerful tool in gene detection and quantification in living cells. Here we report a novel dual molecular beacons approach to reduce false-positive signals in detecting target nucleic acids in homogeneous assays. A pair of molecular beacons, each containing a fluorescence quencher and a reporter fluorophore, one with a donor and a second with an acceptor fluorophore, hybridize to adjacent regions on the same target resulting in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The detection of a FRET signal leads to a substantially increased signal-to-background ratio compared with that seen in single molecular beacon assays and enables discrimination between fluorescence due to specific probe/target hybridization and a variety of possible false-positive events. Further, when a lanthanide chelate is used as a donor in a dual-probe assay, extremely high signal-to-background ratios can be achieved owing to the long lifetime and sharp emission peaks of the donor and the time-gated detection of acceptor fluorescence emission. These new approaches allow for the ultrasensitive detection of target molecules in a way that could be readily applied to real-time imaging of gene expression in living cells.},

Comparison of the photophysics of Texas Red (TR), fluorescein and 5'-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled aptamers reveals surprising differences with significant implications for measurements of oligonucleotide structure and dynamics. The fluorescence decay of the TR-aptamer is a simple single exponential with a weak temperature dependence. The fluorescence decay of the fluorescein-aptamer (fl-aptamer) is pH dependent and displays a complex temperature dependence with significant changes on melting of the aptamer tertiary structure. Despite its similarities to TR, TAMRA is strongly quenched when conjugated to the aptamer and displays complex fluorescence kinetics best described by a distributed rate model. Using the maximum entropy method, we have discovered two highly temperature-dependent fluorescence lifetimes for the TAMRA-aptamer. One of these lifetimes is similar to that of free TAMRA and displays the same temperature dependence. The other lifetime is quenched and displays a temperature dependence characteristic of a charge transfer reaction. These data set TR apart as an attractive alternative to TAMRA and fluorescein for studies such as fluorescence polarization and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, where environmental sensitivity of the probe is not desired.},

   Abstract = {Switchable FRET is the combination of single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) with photoswitching, the reversible activation and deactivation of fluorophores by light. By photoswitching, multiple donor-acceptor fluorophore pairs can be probed sequentially, thus allowing observation of multiple distances within a single immobilized molecule. Control of the photoinduced switching rates permits adjustment of the temporal resolution of switchable FRET over a wide range of timescales, thereby facilitating application to various dynamical biological systems. We show that fast total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy can achieve measurements of two FRET pairs with 10 ms temporal resolution within less than 2 s. The concept of switchable FRET is also compatible with confocal microscopy on immobilized molecules, providing better data quality at high temporal resolution. To identify states and extract their transitions from switchable FRET time traces, we also develop linked hidden Markov modeling (HMM) of both FRET and donor-acceptor stoichiometry. Linked HMM successfully identifies transient states in the two-dimensional FRET-stoichiometry space and reconstructs their connectivity network. Improved temporal resolution and novel data analysis make switchable FRET a valuable tool in molecular and structural biology.},

Although multipair FRET approaches that monitor multiple distances have been developed, they are technically challenging and difficult to extend, mainly because of their reliance on spectrally distinct acceptors. In contrast, switchable FRET sequentially probes FRET between a single donor and spectrally identical photoswitchable acceptors, dramatically reducing the experimental and analytical complexity and enabling direct monitoring of multiple distances. Our experiments on DNA molecules, a protein-DNA complex and dynamic Holliday junctions demonstrate the potential of switchable FRET for studying dynamic, multicomponent biomolecules.},

   Abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is an important source of long-range distance information in macromolecules. However, extracting maximum information requires knowledge of fluorophore, donor and acceptor, positions on the macromolecule. We previously determined the structure of the indocarbocyanine fluorophores Cy3 and Cy5 attached to DNA via three-carbon atom tethers, showing that they stacked onto the end of the helix in a manner similar to an additional basepair. Our recent FRET study has suggested that when they are attached via a longer 13-atom tether, these fluorophores are repositioned relative to the terminal basepair by a rotation of approximately 30 degrees , while remaining stacked. In this study, we have used NMR to extend our structural understanding to the commonly used fluorophore sulfoindocarbocyanine-3 (sCy3) attached to the 5'-terminus of the double-helical DNA via a 13-atom flexible tether (L13). We find that L13-sCy3 remains predominantly stacked onto the end of the duplex, but adopts a significantly different conformation, from that of either Cy3 or Cy5 attached by 3-atom tethers, with the long axes of the fluorophore and the terminal basepair approximately parallel. This result is in close agreement with our FRET data, supporting the contention that FRET data can be used to provide orientational information.},

   Abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were used to examine the structural dynamics of two fluorescent probes attached to a typical protein, hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL). The donor probe (D) was attached via a succinimide group, consistent with the commonly-used maleimide conjugation chemistry, and the acceptor probe (A) was bound into the protein as occurs naturally for HEWL and the dye Eosin Y. The <kappa(2)> is found to deviate significantly from the theoretical value and high correlation between the orientation factor kappa and the distance R is observed. The correlation is quantified using several possible fixed A orientations and correlation as high as 0.80 is found between kappa and R and as high as 0.68 between kappa(2) and R. The presence of this correlation highlights the fact that essentially all fluorescence-detected resonance energy transfer studies have assumed that kappa and R are independent--an assumption that is clearly not justified in the system studied here. The correlation results in the quantities <kappa(2)R(-)(6)> and <kappa(2)> < R(-)(6)> differing by a factor of 1.6. The observed correlation between kappa and R is caused by the succinimide linkage between the D and HEWL, which is found to be relatively inflexible.},

   Abstract = {Fluorescence and phosphorescence depolarization techniques can provide information on orientational order and rotational motion of crossbridges in muscle fibres. However the depolarization experiment monitors the orientation and motion of the crossbridges indirectly. The changes in depolarization arise from a change in the orientation of the transition dipoles of the dye attached to the crossbridge. In order to extract the physiologically relevant orientations from the data it is therefore necessary to characterize the orientation of the dye molecule relative to the crossbridge and the orientation of the transition moments in the frame of the dyes. The dyes 1,5-I-AEDANS and eosin-5-maleimide are commonly used for labelling the crossbridge in muscle fibres. The orientations of the absorption and fluorescence emission dipoles of these two dyes in the molecular frame were determined. Angle resolved fluorescence depolarization experiments on the dyes, macroscopically aligned in a stretched polymer matrix of poly vinyl alcohol, were carried out. The data were analyzed in terms of an orientational distribution of the dye molecules in the film and the orientations of the absorption and emission dipoles in the frame of the dye molecule. Experimental data, obtained from a given sample at different excitation wavelengths, were analyzed simultaneously in a global target approach. This leads to a reduction in the number of independent parameters optimized by the non-linear least squares procedure.},

Moreover, multiple incorporations yield the helical organization of the chromophores inside or outside the DNA or RNA double helix depending upon the conjugation of the chromophores. Significant photophysical interactions are observed in the chromophore stacks resulting in unique optical properties that are significantly different from the monomer properties.

   Abstract = {Fluorescent molecular switches have widespread potential for use as sensors, material applications in electro-optical data storages and displays, and superresolution fluorescence microscopy. We demonstrate that adjustment of fluorophore properties and environmental conditions allows the use of ordinary fluorescent dyes as efficient single-molecule switches that report sensitively on their local redox condition. Adding or removing reductant or oxidant, switches the fluorescence of oxazine dyes between stable fluorescent and nonfluorescent states. At low oxygen concentrations, the off-state that we ascribe to a radical anion is thermally stable with a lifetime in the minutes range. The molecular switches show a remarkable reliability with intriguing fatigue resistance at the single-molecule level: Depending on the switching rate, between 400 and 3,000 switching cycles are observed before irreversible photodestruction occurs. A detailed picture of the underlying photoinduced and redox reactions is elaborated. In the presence of both reductant and oxidant, continuous switching is manifested by "blinking" with independently controllable on- and off-state lifetimes in both deoxygenated and oxygenated environments. This "continuous switching mode" is advantageously used for imaging actin filament and actin filament bundles in fixed cells with subdiffraction-limited resolution.},

   Abstract = {The role and interplay of triplet states and radical ion states in single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy has recently been elaborated providing us with new insights into the photophysics and photobleaching pathways of fluorescent dyes. Adjustment of fluorophore redox properties in combination with specific redox properties of the environment, i.e. addition of reducing and oxidizing agents, allows control of the emission properties: it has become possible to suppress blinking and to also induce blinking in single-molecule fluorescence transient by selectively opening and closing specific excited state pathways. Induced blinking is, for example, of interest for super-resolution fluorescence microscopy based on the subsequent localization of single fluorophores. For oxazines this control even allowed the separation of the influence of reducing and oxidizing agents, enabling switching the fluorescence of single fluorophores. Here, we study the factors that contribute to the kinetics of the photophysical pathways more closely with a focus on the photophysics of the oxazine ATTO655 labeled to DNA. Our data show that the oxazine ATTO655 interacts with DNA, shielding it efficiently from reagents in solution. Besides redox reactions, the pH also influences the blinking kinetics and especially the off-times. Moreover, we present the extension of ATTO655 as a single-molecule redox sensor to a ratiometric fluorescence-resonance-energy-transfer based sensor. Therefore, we designed FRET probes that showed the highest possible contrast of FRET changes and demonstrate reversible FRET-switching of Cy3B-ATTO655 DNA constructs.},

   Abstract = {RNA performs a multitude of essential cellular functions involving the maintenance, transfer, and processing of genetic information. The reason probably is twofold: (a) Life started as a prebiotic RNA World, in which RNA served as the genetic information carrier and catalyzed all chemical reactions required for its proliferation and (b) some of the RNA World functions were conserved throughout evolution because neither DNA nor protein is as adept in fulfilling them. A particular advantage of RNA is its high propensity to form alternative structures as required in subsequent steps of a reaction pathway. Here I describe fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) as a method to monitor a crucial conformational transition on the reaction pathway of the hairpin ribozyme, a small catalytic RNA motif from a self-replicating plant virus satellite RNA and well-studied paradigm of RNA folding. Steady-state FRET measurements in solution allow one to measure the kinetics and requirements of docking of its two independently folding domains; time-resolved FRET reveals the relative thermodynamic stability of the undocked (extended, inactive) and docked (active) ribozyme conformations; while single-molecule FRET experiments will highlight the dynamics of RNA at the individual molecule level. Similar domain docking events are expected to be at the heart of many biological functions of RNA, and the described FRET techniques promise to be adaptable to most of the involved RNA systems.},

   Abstract = {We measured absorption and emission spectra, fluorescence quantum yield, anisotropy, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and melting temperature to characterize fluorescein- and tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled oligonucleotides in solution and when hybridized to a common DNA template. Upon hybridization to the template, both the absorption and emission spectra of TMR-labeled duplexes exhibited a shift with respect to those of labeled oligonucleotides, depending on the location of the TMR on the oligonucleotide. Measurements of quantum yield, anisotropy, and melting temperature indicated that TMR interacted with nucleotides within the duplexes in the order (T1>T5>T11, T16) that the oligonucleotide with TMR labeled at the 5' end (T1) is stronger than that labeled at position 5 from the 5' end (T5), which is also stronger than those labeled at the positions, 11 and 16, from the 5' end (T11, T16). In the case of the duplex formed between T1 and the template, fluorescence quenching was observed, which is attributed to the interaction between the dye molecule and guanosines located at the single-stranded portion of the template. A two-state model was suggested to describe the conformational states of TMR in the duplex. The melting temperatures of the four FRET complexes show the same pattern as those of TMR-labeled duplexes. We infer that the interactions between TMR and guanosine persist in the FRET complexes. This interaction may bring the donor and the acceptor molecules closely together, which could cause interaction between the two dye molecules shown in absorbance measurements of the FRET complexes.},

   Abstract = {Precise measurement of the potential of mean force is necessary for a fundamental understanding of the dynamics and chemical reactivity of a biological macromolecule. The unique advantage provided by the recently developed constant-information approach to analyzing time-dependent single-molecule fluorescence measurements was used with maximum entropy deconvolution to create a procedure for the accurate determination of molecular conformational distributions, and analytical expressions for the errors in these distributions were derived. This new method was applied to a derivatized poly(L-proline) series, P(n)CG3K(biotin) (n = 8, 12, 15, 18, and 24), using a modular, server-based single-molecule spectrometer that is capable of registering photon arrival times with a continuous-wave excitation source. To account for potential influence from the microscopic environment, factors that were calibrated and corrected molecule by molecule include background, cross-talk, and detection efficiency. For each single poly(L-proline) molecule, sharply peaked Forster type resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency and distance distributions were recovered, indicating a static end-to-end distance on the time scale of measurement. The experimental distances were compared with models of varying rigidity. The results suggest that the 23 angstroms persistence length wormlike chain model derived from experiments with high molecular weight poly(L-proline) is applicable to short chains as well.},

   Abstract = {The power of FRET to study molecular complexes is expanded by the use of two or more donor/acceptor pairs. A general theoretical framework for distance measurements in three-chromophore systems is presented. Three energy transfer schemes applicable to many diverse situations are considered: (I) two-step FRET relay with FRET between the first and second chromophores and between the second and third, (II) FRET from a single donor to two different acceptors, and (III) two-step FRET relay with FRET also between the first and third chromophores. Equations for the efficiencies involving multiple energy transfer steps are derived for both donor quenching and sensitized emission measurements. The theory is supported by experimental data on model systems of known structure using steady-state donor quenching, lifetime quenching, and sensitized emission. The distances measured in the three-chromophore systems agree with those in two-chromophore systems and molecular models. Finally, labeling requirements for diagnosis of the energy transfer scheme and subsequent distance measurements are discussed.},

Using the multiple fluorescence dimensions, we demonstrate a dye labeling scheme of oligonucleotides, by which it is possible to identify and separate 16 different compounds in the mixture via their characteristic pattern by MFD. Such identification procedures and multiplex assays with single-molecule sensitivity may have a great impact on screening of species and events that do not lend themselves so easily to amplification, such as disease-specific proteins and their interactions.},

   Abstract = {The use of fluorescent nucleic acid base analogues is becoming increasingly important in the fields of biology, biochemistry and biophysical chemistry as well as in the field of DNA nanotechnology. The advantage of being able to incorporate a fluorescent probe molecule close to the site of examination in the nucleic acid-containing system of interest with merely a minimal perturbation to the natural structure makes fluorescent base analogues highly attractive. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing novel candidates in this group of fluorophores for utilization in various investigations. This review describes the different classes of fluorophores that can be used for studying nucleic acid-containing systems, with an emphasis on choosing the right kind of probe for the system under investigation. It describes the characteristics of the large group of base analogues that has an emission that is sensitive to the surrounding microenvironment and gives examples of investigations in which this group of molecules has been used so far. Furthermore, the characterization and use of fluorescent base analogues that are virtually insensitive to changes in their microenvironment are described in detail. This group of base analogues can be used in several fluorescence investigations of nucleic acids, especially in fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. Finally, the development and characterization of the first nucleic base analogue FRET pair, tC(O)-tC(nitro), and its possible future uses are discussed.},

   Abstract = {Local DNA deformation arises from an interplay among sequence-related base stacking, intrastrand phosphate repulsion, and counterion and water distribution, which is further complicated by the approach and binding of a protein. The role of electrostatics in this complex chemistry was investigated using tethered cationic groups that mimic proximate side chains. A DNA duplex was modified with one or two centrally located deoxyuracils substituted at the 5-position with either a flexible 3-aminopropyl group or a rigid 3-aminopropyn-1-yl group. End-to-end helical distances and duplex flexibility were obtained from measurements of the time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer between 5'- and 3'-linked dye pairs. A novel analysis utilized the first and second moments of the G(t) function, which encompasses only the energy transfer process. Duplex flexibility is altered by the presence of even a single positive charge. In contrast, the mean 5'-3' distance is significantly altered by the introduction of two adjacently tethered cations into the double helix but not by a single cation: two adjacent aminopropyl groups decrease the 5'-3' distance while neighboring aminopropynyl groups lengthen the helix.},

   Abstract = {We present advances in the use of single-molecule FRET measurements with flexibly linked dyes to derive full 3D structures of DNA constructs based on absolute distances. The resolution obtained by this single-molecule approach harbours the potential to study in detail also protein- or damage-induced DNA bending. If one is to generate a geometric structural model, distances between fixed positions are needed. These are usually not experimentally accessible because of unknown fluorophore-linker mobility effects that lead to a distribution of FRET efficiencies and distances. To solve this problem, we performed studies on DNA double-helices by systematically varying donor acceptor distances from 2 to 10 nm. Analysis of dye-dye quenching and fluorescence anisotropy measurements reveal slow positional and fast orientational fluorophore dynamics, that results in an isotropic average of the FRET efficiency. We use a nonlinear conversion function based on MD simulations that allows us to include this effect in the calculation of absolute FRET distances. To obtain unique structures, we performed a quantitative statistical analysis for the conformational search in full space based on triangulation, which uses the known helical nucleic acid features. Our higher accuracy allowed the detection of sequence-dependent DNA bending by 16 degrees . For DNA with bulged adenosines, we also quantified the kink angles introduced by the insertion of 1, 3 and 5 bases to be 32 degrees +/- 6 degrees , 56 degrees +/- 4 degrees and 73 +/- 2 degrees , respectively. Moreover, the rotation angles and shifts of the helices were calculated to describe the relative orientation of the two arms in detail.},

   Abstract = {The TATA-binding protein (TBP) initiates assembly of transcription preinitiation complexes on eukaryotic class II promoters, binding to and restructuring consensus and variant "TATA box" sequences. The sequence dependence of the DNA structure in TBP-TATA complexes has been investigated in solution using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The mean 5'dye-3'dye distance varies significantly among oligomers bearing the adenovirus major late promoter sequence (AdMLP) and five single-site variants bound to Saccharomyces cerevisiae TBP, consistent with solution bend angles for AdMLP of 76 degrees and for the variants ranging from 30 degrees to 62 degrees. These solution bends contrast sharply with the corresponding co-crystal structures, which show approximately 80 degrees bends for all sequences. Transcription activities for these TATA sequences are strongly correlated with the solution bend angles but not with TBP-DNA binding affinities. Our results support a model in which transcription efficiency derives primarily from the sequence-dependent structure of the TBP-TATA binary complex. Specifically, the distance distribution for the average solution structure of the TBP-TATA complex may reflect the sequence-dependent probability for the complex to assume a conformation in which the TATA box DNA is severely bent. Upon assumption of this geometry, the binary complex becomes a target for binding and correctly orienting the other components of the preinitiation complex.},

Consequently, the fluorescein acts as a fluorescence resonance energy-transfer gate to relay the excitation energy from the CCP to the EB.},

   Abstract = {Time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer has been used to examine the global structure and conformational flexibility of three-way DNA junctions containing unpaired bases at the branch point. Three-way junctions were prepared with donor (fluorescein) and acceptor (tetramethyl-rhodamine) dyes attached to the ends of different helical arms in various pairwise combinations. The time-resolved fluorescence decay of the donor in each labeled junction was measured by time-correlated single photon counting. The distributions of donor-acceptor (D-A) distances present between each pair of labeled helices were recovered from analysis of the donor decay profiles using a Gaussian distribution model. The recovered D-A distance distributions reveal the mean distance between each pair of helices, as well as the range of distances that exists between each pair. For the junction lacking unpaired bases, the three mean interarm distances are similar, indicating an extended structure. In addition, a relatively broad range of distances is present between each pair of helices, showing that the structure is flexible. The addition of unpaired bases causes the junction to fold into a different structure, with one interarm distance being shorter than the other two. The change in overall geometry of the junction appears to be primarily due to the repositioning of one of the helices flanking the bulge. In bulged junctions containing unpaired thymine, cytosine, or adenine bases, the helix containing the 3' portion of the bulged strand appears to undergo the greatest change in its mean position relative to the other helices. In contrast, in the bulged junction containing unpaired guanine bases, the helix containing the 5' portion of the bulged strand is displaced. In all bulged junctions, there is a wide range of distances between the perturbed helix and the other two helices, indicating high mobility for the perturbed arm. These results indicate that the overall structure and conformational flexibility of three-way DNA junctions are sensitive to the presence of unpaired bases at the branch point of the junction and that the precise effect of a bulge depends on the nature of the unpaired bases.},

   Abstract = {U2 and U6 snRNAs pair to form a phylogenetically conserved complex at the catalytic core of the spliceosome. Interactions with divalent metal ions, particularly Mg(II), at specific sites are essential for its folding and catalytic activity. We used a novel Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) method between site-bound luminescent lanthanide ions and a covalently attached fluorescent dye, combined with supporting stoichiometric and mutational studies, to determine locations of site-bound Tb(III) within the human U2-U6 complex. At pH 7.2, we detected three metal-ion-binding sites in: (1) the consensus ACACAGA sequence, which forms the internal loop between helices I and III; (2) the four-way junction, which contains the conserved AGC triad; and (3) the internal loop of the U6 intra-molecular stem loop (ISL). Binding at each of these sites is supported by previous phosphorothioate substitution studies and, in the case of the ISL site, by NMR. Binding of Tb(III) at the four-way junction and the ISL sites was found to be pH-dependent, with no ion binding observed below pH 6 and 7, respectively. This pH dependence of metal ion binding suggests that the local environment may play a role in the binding of metal ions, which may impact on splicing activity.},

   Abstract = {Optical-based distance measurements are essential for tracking biomolecular conformational changes, drug discovery, and cell biology. Traditional Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is efficient for separation distances up to 100 A.

We appended a 1.4 nm Au cluster to the 5' end of one DNA strand as the energy acceptor and a fluorescein (FAM) to the 5' end of the complementary strand as the energy donor. Analysis of the energy transfer on DNA lengths (15, 20, 30, 60bp), complemented by protein-induced DNA bending, provides the basis for fully mapping the extent of this dipole surface type mechanism over its entire usable range (50-250 A). Further, protein function is fully compatible with these nanometal-DNA constructs. Significantly extending the range of optical based methods in molecular rulers is an important leap forward for biophysics.},

A Cy5-labeled oligonucleotide was chemically bound to a single silver particle with a distance of 2 or 10 nm from the surface of metal core. A Cy5.5-labeled complementary oligonucleotide was bound to the particle-conjugated oligonucleotide by hybridization. The spacer length between donor-acceptor was adjusted by the number of base pairs. FRET between the donor-acceptor pair was investigated by dual-channel single-molecule fluorescence detection. Both the emission intensities and lifetimes indicated that FRET was enhanced efficiently by the metal particles. The results showed an increase of apparent energy transfer distance with the size of silver particle and distance from the metal core. Simulations by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations were used to compare with the experimental results. The local fields at the location of the donor-acceptor pair appeared to correlate with the FRET efficiency.

Here we report new Monte-Carlo simulations of deformable DNA molecules of potential utility in understanding the behavior of the long, double-helical polymer in the tight confines of a cell and in the design of novel nanomaterials and molecular devices. We directly determine the fluctuations in end-to-end extension associated with the conventional elastic-rod representation of DNA and with more realistic models that take account of the precise deformability of the constituent base-pair steps. Notably, the variance of end-to-end distance shows a quadratic increase with chain length in short chains of both types. We also consider the contributions to chain extension from the chemical linkages used to attach small molecular probes to DNA. The distribution of computed distances is sensitive to the intrinsic structure and allowed deformations of the tether. Surprisingly, the enhancement in end-to-end variance associated with the presence of the probe depends upon chain length, even when the probe is rigidly connected to DNA. We find that the elastic rod model of DNA in combination with a slightly fluctuating tether accounts satisfactorily for the distributions of end-to-end distances extracted from the small-angle X-ray scattering of gold nanocrystals covalently linked to the ends of short DNAs. There is no need to introduce additional structural fluctuations to reproduce the measured uptake in end-to-end fluctuations with chain length.},

We demonstrate the method in fixed and living cells using a novel GFP based FRET pair (GFP2-YFP (yellow)), which has an increased FRET efficiency compared to the most commonly used FRET pair consisting of cyan fluorescent protein and YFP. Moreover, GFP2 has its excitation maximum at 396 nm at which the YFP acceptor is excited only below the detection level and thus this FRET pair is ideal for applications involving sensitized emission.},
