\chapter{Results of experiments with \sgp}
\label{app:sgp}
\textit{This Appendix, presents graphically a summary of individuals runs using \sgp. Figures show a \textit{box-plot} representation, indicating also, for each experiment, the percentage of communicating solvers finding the solution thanks to received information.}
