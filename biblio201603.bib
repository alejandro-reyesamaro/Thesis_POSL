abstract = {We pose a new and intriguing question motivated by distributed computing regarding random walks on graphs: How long does it take for several independent random walks, starting from the same vertex, to cover an entire graph? We study the cover time - the expected time required to visit every node in a graph at least once - and we show that for a large collection of interesting graphs, running many random walks in parallel yields a speed-up in the cover time that is linear in the number of parallel walks. We demonstrate that an exponential speed-up is sometimes possible, but that some natural graphs allow only a logarithmic speed-up. A problem related to ours (in which the walks start from some probabilistic distribution on vertices) was previously studied in the context of space efficient algorithms for undirected s-t connectivity and our results yield, in certain cases, an improvement upon some of the earlier bounds.},

abstract = {Recent research has shown that the performances of a single arbitrarily efficient solver can be significantly out- performed by a portfolio of possibly slower on-average solvers. The solver selection is usually done by using machine learning techniques which exploit features extracted from the problem specification. In this paper we present a tool that is able to extract an extensive set of features from a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) defined either in the MiniZinc format or in the XCSP format. We also report some empirical results showing that the performances that can be obtained using these features are competitive with state of the art CSP portfolio techniques},

The massively parallel architecture of the GPU makes it possible to explore parallelism at two different levels inside the local search algorithm. First, by executing multiple copies of the algorithm in a multi-walk manner and, second, by evaluating large neighborhoods in parallel in a single-walk manner. Experiments on three well-known problem benchmarks indicate that the current GPU implementation is up to 17 times faster than a well-tuned sequential algorithm implemented on a desktop computer.},

Designs range from conventional multiprocessor machines to designs that consist of a "sea" of programmable arithmetic logic units (ALUs). In this article, we cover some of the attributes common to all multicore processor implementations and illustrate these attributes with current and future commercial multicore designs. The characteristics we focus on are application domain, power/performance, processing elements, memory system, and accelerators/integrated peripherals.},

Drawing upon models used to simulate far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it complements approximation methods inspired by equilibrium statistical physics, such as Simulated Annealing. With only one adjustable parameter, its performance proves competitive with, and often superior to, more elaborate stochastic optimization procedures. We demonstrate it here on two classic hard optimization problems: graph partitioning and the traveling salesman problem.},

Proper choice of burst waveform parameters is shown to result in a detection wave-form having range and Doppler resolution properties consistent with the overall signal duration and bandwidth. The range-Doppler sidelobe peaks are well-controlled so that the ideal "thumbtack" ambiguity function behavior is closely approximated by the synthesis procedure presented.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a survey of the different parallel programming models and tools available today with special consideration to their suitability for high-performance computing. Thus, we review the shared and distributed memory approaches, as well as the current heterogeneous parallel programming model. In addition, we analyze how the partitioned global address space (PGAS) and hybrid parallel programming models are used to combine the advantages of shared and distributed memory systems. The work is completed by considering languages with specific parallel support and the distributed programming paradigm. In all cases, we present characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. The study shows that the availability of multi-core CPUs has given new impulse to the shared memory parallel programming approach. In addition, we find that hybrid parallel programming is the current way of harnessing the capabilities of computer clusters with multi-core nodes. On the other hand, heterogeneous programming is found to be an increasingly popular paradigm, as a consequence of the availability of multi-core CPUs+GPUs systems. The use of open industry standards like OpenMP, MPI, or OpenCL, as opposed to proprietary solutions, seems to be the way to uniformize and extend the use of parallel programming models.},

abstract = {The development of successful metaheuristic algorithms such as local search for a difficult problem such as satisfiability testing (SAT) is a challenging task. We investigate an evolutionary approach to automating the discovery of new local search heuristics for SAT. We show that several well-known SAT local search algorithms such as Walksat and Novelty are composite heuristics that are derived from novel combinations of a set of building blocks. Based on this observation, we developed CLASS, a genetic programming system that uses a simple composition operator to automatically discover SAT local search heuristics. New heuristics discovered by CLASS are shown to be competitive with the best Walksat variants, including Novelty+. Evolutionary algorithms have previously been applied to directly evolve a solution for a particular SAT instance. We show that the heuristics discovered by CLASS are also competitive with these previous, direct evolutionary approaches for SAT. We also analyze the local search behavior of the learned heuristics using the depth, mobility, and coverage metrics proposed by Schuurmans and Southey.},

We propose a general definition and a taxonomy of search processes with respect to their computation characteristics. For this purpose, we decompose solvers into components and their configurations. Some computation rules between computation stages are used to formalize the solver modifications and adaptations.

abstract = {Large-scale, parallel clusters composed of commodity processors are increasingly available, enabling the use of vast processing capabilities and distributed RAM to solve hard search problems. We investigate Hash-Distributed A⁎ (HDA⁎), a simple approach to parallel best-first search that asynchronously distributes and schedules work among processors based on a hash function of the search state. We use this approach to parallelize the A⁎ algorithm in an optimal sequential version of the Fast Downward planner, as well as a 24-puzzle solver. The scaling behavior of HDA⁎ is evaluated experimentally on a shared memory, multicore machine with 8 cores, a cluster of commodity machines using up to 64 cores, and large-scale high-performance clusters, using up to 2400 processors. We show that this approach scales well, allowing the effective utilization of large amounts of distributed memory to optimally solve problems which require terabytes of RAM. We also compare HDA⁎ to Transposition-table Driven Scheduling (TDS), a hash-based parallelization of IDA⁎, and show that, in planning, HDA⁎ significantly outperforms TDS. A simple hybrid which combines HDA⁎ and TDS to exploit strengths of both algorithms is proposed and evaluated.},

abstract = {On the one hand, Constraint Satisfaction Problems allow one to declaratively model problems. On the other hand, propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) solvers can handle huge SAT instances. We thus present a technique to declaratively model set constraint problems and to encode them automatically into SAT instances. We apply our technique to the Social Golfer Problem and we also use it to break symmetries of the problem. Our technique is simpler, more declarative, and less error-prone than direct and improved hand modeling. The SAT instances that we automatically generate contain less clauses than improved hand-written instances such as in [20], and with unit propagation they also contain less variables. Moreover, they are well-suited for SAT solvers and they are solved faster as shown when solving difficult instances of the Social Golfer Problem.},

abstract = {In this paper, we are concerned with the design of a hybrid resolution framework. We develop a theoretical model based on chaotic iterations in which hybrid resolution can be achieved as the computation of a fixpoint of elementary functions. These functions correspond to basic resolution techniques and their applications can easily be parameterized by different search strategies. This framework is used for the hybridiza- tion of local search and constraint propagation, and for the integration of genetic algorithms and constraint propagation. Our prototype imple- mentation gave experimental results showing the interest of the model to design such hybridizations.},

@article{Morgan2012,
abstract = {In this paper we extend a previously proposed randomized landscape generator in combination with a comparative experimental methodology to study the behavior of continuous metaheuristic optimization algorithms. In particular, we generate two-dimensional landscapes with parameterized, linear ridge structure, and perform pairwise comparisons of algorithms to gain insight into what kind of problems are easy and difficult for one algorithm instance relative to another. We apply this methodology to investigate the specific issue of explicit dependency modeling in simple continuous estimation of distribution algorithms. Experimental results reveal specific examples of landscapes (with certain identifiable features) where dependency modeling is useful, harmful, or has little impact on mean algorithm performance. Heat maps are used to compare algorithm performance over a large number of landscape instances and algorithm trials. Finally, we perform a meta-search in the landscape parameter space to find landscapes which maximize the performance between algorithms. The results are related to some previous intuition about the behavior of these algorithms, but at the same time lead to new insights into the relationship between dependency modeling in EDAs and the structure of the problem landscape. The landscape generator and overall methodology are quite general and extendable and can be used to examine specific features of other algorithms.},

abstract = {We present and evaluate a method for estimating the relevance and calibrating the values of parameters of an evolutionary algorithm. The method provides an information theoretic measure on how sensitive a parameter is to the choice of its value. This can be used to estimate the relevance of parameters, to choose between different possible sets of parameters, and to allocate resources to the calibration of relevant parameters. The method calibrates the evolutionary algorithm to reach a high performance, while retaining a maximum of robustness and generalizability. We demonstrate the method on an agent-based application from evolutionary economics and show how the method helps to design an evolutionary algorithm that allows the agents to achieve a high welfare with a minimum of algorithmic complexity.},

abstract = {There is no standard modelling language for constraint programming (CP) problems. Most solvers have their own modelling language. This makes it difficult for modellers to experiment with different solvers for a problem. In this paper we present MiniZinc, a simple but expressive CP modelling language which is suitable for modelling problems for a range ofsolvers and provides a reasonable compromise between many design possibilities. Equally importantly, we also propose a low-level solver-input language called FlatZinc, and a straightforward translation from MiniZinc to FlatZinc that preserves all solver-supported global constraints. This lets a solver writer support MiniZinc with a minimum of effort they only need to provide a simple FlatZinc front-end to their solver, and then combine it with an existing MiniZinc-to-FlatZinc translator. Such a front-end may then serve as a stepping stone towards a full MiniZinc implementation that is more tailored to the particular solver. A standard language for modelling CP problems will encourage experimentation with and comparisons between different solvers. Although MiniZinc is not perfect - no standard modelling language will be - we believe its simplicity, expressiveness, and ease of implementation make it a practical choice for a standard language.},

We split the initial problem into a huge number of independent subproblems and solve them with available workers, for instance cores of machines. The decomposition into subproblems is computed by selecting a subset of variables and by enumerating the combinations of values of these variables that are not detected inconsistent by the propagation mechanism of a CP Solver. The experiments on satisfaction problems and optimization problems suggest that generating between thirty and one hundred subproblems per worker leads to a good scalability. We show that our method is quite competitive with thework stealing approach and able to solve some classical problems at the maximum capacity of the multi-core machines. Thanks to it, a user can parallelize the resolution of its problemwithout modifying the solver or writing any parallel source code and can easily replay the resolution of a problem.},

@article{Riff2013,
abstract = {The process of designing a metaheuristic is a difficult and time consuming task as it usually requires tuning to find the best associated parameter values. In this paper, we propose a simple tuning tool called EVOCA which allows unexperimented metaheuristic designers to obtain good quality results without have a strong knowledge in tuning methods. The simplicity here means that the designer does not have to care about the initial settings of the tuner. We apply EVOCA to a genetic algorithm that solves NK landscape instances of various categories. We show that EVOCA is able to tune both categorical and numerical parameters allowing the designer to discard ineffective components for the algorithm.},

The parallel solver coordinates autonomous instances of a sequential constraint solver, which is used as a software component. The component solvers achieve load balancing of tree search through a time-out mechanism. Experiments show that the purely exogenous mode of coordination employed here yields a viable parallel solver that effectively reduces turn-around time for constraint solving on a broad range of hardware platforms.},
