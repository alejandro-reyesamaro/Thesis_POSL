In this section I present the performed study using \sgp{} (\SGP) as a benchmark. The \commstr{} analyzed in here consists in applying a mechanism of cost descending acceleration, exchanging the current configuration between two solvers with different characteristics. Final obtained results show that this \commstr{} works pretty well for this problem.

\subsection{Problem definition}

The \sgp{} (\SGP) consists in scheduling $g\times p$ golfers into $g$ groups of $p$ players every week for $w$ weeks, such that two players play in the same group at most once. An instance of this problem can be represented by the triple $g-p-w$. This problem, and other closely related problems, arise in many practical applications such as encoding, encryption, and covering problems~\cite{Lardeux2014}. Its structure is very attractive, because it is very similar to other problems, like \textit{Kirkman's Schoolgirl Problem} and the \textit{Steiner Triple System}. %, so efficient modules to solve a broad range of problems can be built.

The cost function for this benchmark was implemented making an efficient use of the stored information about the cost of the previews configuration. Using integers to work with bit-flags, a table to store the information about the partners of each player in each week can be filled in $O\left(p^2\cdot g \cdot w\right)$. So, if a configuration has $n = (p\cdot g \cdot w)$ elements, this table can be filled in $O\left(p\cdot n\right)$. This table is filled from scratch only one time in the search process (I explain in the next section why). Then, every cost of a new configuration, is calculated based on this information and the performed changes between the new configuration and the stored one. This relative cost is calculated in $O\left(c\cdot g\right)$, where $c$ is the number of performed changed in the new configuration with respect to the stored one.

\subsection{Experiment design and results}

Here, I present the \as{} designed for this problem as well as concrete \oms{} composing the different solvers I have tested:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Generation abstract module $I$:
	\subitem $I_{BP}$: Returns a random configuration $s$, respecting the structure of the problem, {\it i.e.}, the configuration is a set of $w$ permutations of the vector $[1..n]$, where $n=g\times p$.
	\item Neighborhood abstract modules $V$:
	\subitem $V_{std}$: Given a configuration, returns the neighborhood $\mathcal{V}\left(s\right)$ swapping players among groups.
	\subitem $V_{BAS}$: Given a configuration, returns the neighborhood $\mathcal{V}\left(s\right)$ swapping the most culprit player with other players from the same week. It is based on the {\it Adaptive Search} algorithm.
	\subitem $V_{BP}(p)$: Given a configuration, returns the neighborhood $V\left(s\right)$ by swapping the culprit player chosen for all $p$ randomly selected weeks with other players in the same week
	\item Selection abstract modules $S$:
	\subitem $S_{first}$: Given a neighborhood, selects the first configuration $s' \in V\left(s\right)$ improving the current cost and returns it together with the current one, into a \textit{decision--pair}
	\subitem $S_{best}$: Given a neighborhood, selects the best configuration $s' \in V\left(s\right)$ improving the current cost and returns it together with the current one, into a \textit{decision--pair}
	\subitem $S_{rand}$: Given a neighborhood, selects randomly a configuration $s' \in V\left(s\right)$ and returns it together with the current one, into a \textit{decision--pair}.
	\item Acceptance abstract module $A$:
	\subitem $A_{AI}$: Given a decision--pair, returns the configuration marked as \textit{"found"}
\end{enumerate}

These concrete modules are very useful and can be reused to solve tournament-like problems like \textit{Sports Tournament Scheduling}, \textit{Kirkman's Schoolgirl} and the \textit{Steiner Triple System} problems.

In a first stage of the experiments I use the operator-based language provided by \posl{} to build and test many different non communicating strategies. The goal is to select the best concrete modules to run tests performing communication. A very first experiment was performed to select the best neighborhood function to solve the problem, comparing a basic solver using $V_{std}$; a new solver using $V_{BAS}$; and a combination of $V_{std}$ and $V_{BAS}$ by applying the operator $\circled{$\rho$}$, already introduced in the previous chapter. Algorithms~\ref{as:golfers10-10-3} and \ref{as:golfers_rho} present solvers for each case, respectively.

Results in Table~\ref{tab:golfers10-10-3} are not surprising. The neighborhood module $V_{BAS}$ is based on the {\it Adaptive Search} algorithm, which has shown very good results \cite{Diaz}. %It selects the variable (player) contributing the most to the cost and permutes its value with the others variables (players) for all groups, every week.
It selects the most culprit variable (i.e., a player), that is, the variable to most responsible for constraints violation. Then, it permutes this variable value with the value of each other variable, in all groups and all weeks. Each permutation gives a neighbor of the current configuration. $V_{Std}$ uses no additional information, so it performs every possible swap between two players in different groups, every week. It means that this neighborhood is $g\times p$ times bigger than the previous one, with $g$ the number of groups and $p$ the number of players per group. 
It allows for more organized search because the set of neighbors is pseudo-deterministic, i.e., the construction criteria is always the same but the order of the configuration is random. On the other hand, {\it Adaptive Search} neighborhood function takes random decisions more frequently, and the order of the configurations is random as well. We also tested solvers with different combinations of these modules, using the $\circled{$\rho$}$ and the $\circled{$\cup$}$ operators. The $\circled{$\rho$}$ operator executes its first or second parameter depending on a given probability $\rho$, and the $\circled{$\cup$}$ operator returns the union of its parameters output. All these combinations spent more time searching the best configuration among the neighborhood, although with a lower number of iterations than $V_{BAS}$. The $V_{BAS}$ neighborhood function being clearly faster, we have chosen it for our experiments, even if it shown a more spread standard deviation: 0.75 for AS versus 0.62 for Std, considering the ratio $\tfrac{T(sd)}{T}$.

\separation

With the selected neighborhood function, I have focused the experiment on choosing the best {\it selection} function. Solvers mentioned above were too slow to solve instances of the problem with more than three weeks: they were very often trapped into local minima. For that reason, another solver implementing the \as{} described in Algorithm~\ref{as:golfers_b001} have been created, using $V_{BAS}$ and combining $S_{best}$ and $S_{rand}$: it tries a number of times to improve the cost, and if it is not possible, it picks a random neighbor for the next iteration. We also compared the $S_{first}$ and $S_{best}$ selection modules. The \om{} $S_{best}$ selects the best configuration inside the neighborhood. It not only spent more time searching a better configuration, but also is more sensitive to become trapped into local minima. The second \om{} $S_{first}$ selects the first configuration inside the neighborhood improving the current cost. Using this module, solvers favor exploration over intensification and of course spend clearly less time computing the neighborhood.

Tables~\ref{tab:golfersB001} and \ref{tab:golfers_seq} present results of this experiment, showing that an local exploration-oriented strategy is better for the \SGP. If we compare results of Tables~\ref{tab:golfersB001} \ref{tab:golfers_seq} with respect to the standard deviation, we can some gains in robustness with parallelism. The spread in the running times and iterations for the instance 5--3--7 is 24\% lower (0.84 sequentially versus 0.60 in parallel), for 8--4--7 is 30\% lower (0.55 sequentially versus 0.25 in parallel) and for 9--4--8 (the hardest one) is 43\% lower (0.69 sequentially versus 0.26 in parallel), using the same ratio $\tfrac{T(sd)}{T}$).

\separation

The conclusion of the last experiment was that the best solver to solve \SGP{} using \posl{} is the one using a neighborhood \om{} based on {\it Adaptive Search} algorithm ($V_{BAS}$) and a selection \om{} selecting the first configuration improving the cost. Using this solver as a base, the next step was to design a simple communication strategy were the shared information is the current configuration. Algorithms~\ref{as:golfers_sender}~and~\ref{as:golfers_receiver} show that the communication is performed while applying the acceptance criterion of the new configuration for the next iteration. Here, solvers receive a configuration from a sender solver, and match it with their current configuration. Then solvers select the configuration with the lowest global cost. Different communication strategies were designed, either executing a full connected solvers set, or a tuned combination of connected and unconnected solvers. Between connected solvers, two different connections operations were applied: connecting each sender solver with one receiver solver (\oneTone), or connecting each sender solver with all receiver solvers (\oneTn). The code for the different \commstrs{} are presented in Algorithms~\ref{comm:golfers_1_1-1} to \ref{comm:golfers_1_1-n_25}.

In Algorithm~\ref{as:golfers_receiver}, the abstract \opch{} $C.M.$ was instantiated with the concrete \opch{} $CM_{last}$, which takes into account the last received configuration at the time of its execution.

Each time a \posl{} meta-solver is launched, many independent search solvers are executed. We call "good" configuration a configuration with the lowest cost within the current configuration neighborhood and with a cost strictly lesser than the current one. Once a good configuration is found in a sender solver, it is transmitted to the receiver one. At this moment, if the information is accepted, there are some solvers searching in the same subset of the search space, and the search process becomes more exploitation--oriented. This can be problematic if this process makes solvers converging too often towards local minima. In that case, we waste more than one solver trapped into a local minima: we waste all solvers that have been attracted to this part of the search space because of communications. I avoid this phenomenon through a simple (but effective) play: if a solver is not able to find a better configuration inside the neighborhood (executing $S_{first}$), it selects a random one at the next iteration (executing $S_{rand}$).

In all Algorithms in this section, three parameter can be found:\begin{inparaenum}[1.] \item $K_1$: the maximum number of {\it restarts}, \item $K_2$: the maximum number of iterations in each \textit{restart}, and $K_3$: the maximum number of iterations with the same current cost. \item \end{inparaenum}

After the selection of the proper modules to study different communication strategies, I proceeded to tune these parameter. Only a few runs were necessaries to conclude that the mechanism of using the \om{} $S_{rand}$ to scape from local minima was enough. For that reason, since the solver never perform restarts, the parameter $K_1$ was irrelevant. So the reader can assume $K_1 = 1$ for every experiment.

With the certainty that solvers do not performs restarts during the search process, I select the same value for $K_2 = 5000$ in order to be able to use the same \as{} for all instances.

Finally, in the tuning process of $K_3$, I notice only slightly differences between using the values $5$, $10$, and $15$. So I decided to use $K_3 = 5$.

This communication strategy produces some gain in terms of runtime (Table~\ref{tab:golfersB001} with respect to Tables~\ref{tab:golfersB001comm100}, \ref{tab:golfersB001comm50} and \ref{tab:golfersB001comm25}. 
Having many solvers searching in different places of the search space, the probability that one of them reaches a promising place is higher. Then, when a solver finds a good configuration, it can be communicated, and receiving the help of one or more solvers in order to find the solution.
Using this strategy, the spread in the running times and iterations was reduced for the instance 9--4--8 (0.22 using communication \oneTone{} and 50\% of communication solvers), but not for instances 5--3--7 and 8--4--7 (0.70 using communication \oneTn{} and 50\% of communicating solvers, and 0.28 using communication \oneTone{} and 50\% of communicating solvers, respectively).

Other two strategies were analyzed in the resolution of this problem, with no success, both based on the sub-division of the work by weeks, i.e., solvers trying to improve a configuration only working with one or some weeks. To this end two strategies were designed:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
\item \textbf{Circular strategy:} $K$ solvers try to improve a configuration during a during a number of iteration, only working on one week. When no improvement is obtained, the current configuration is communicated to the next solver (circularly), which tries to do the same working on the next week (see Figure~\ref{subfig:golfers_bad_ring}).
\subitem This strategy does not show better results than previews strategies. The reason is because, although the communication in \posl{} is asynchronous, most of the times solvers were trapped waiting for a configuration coming from its neighbor solver.

\item \textbf{Dichotomy strategy:} Solvers are divided by levels. Solvers in level 1, only work on one week, solvers on level 2, only work on 2 consecutive weeks, and so on, until the solver that works on all (except the first one) weeks. Solvers in level 1 improve a configuration during some number of iteration, then this configuration is sent to the corresponding solver. A solver in level 2 do the same, but working on weeks $k$ to $k+1$. It means that it receives configurations from the solver working on week $k$ and from the solver working on week $k+1$, and sends its configuration to the corresponding solver working on weeks $k$ to $k+3$; and so on. The solver in the last level works on all (except the first one) weeks and receive configuration from the solver working on weeks $2$ to $w/2$ and from the solver working on weeks $w/2+1$ to $w$ (see Figure\ref{subfig:golfers_bad_dic}). We tested this strategy with all possible levels. 
\subitem The goal of this strategy was testing if focused searches rapidly communicated can help at the beginning of the search. However, The failure of this strategy is in the fact that most of the time the sent information arrives to late to the receiver solver.

\separation

One last experiment using this benchmark was a \commstr{}, which applies a mechanism of cost descending acceleration, exchanging the current configuration between two solvers with different characteristics. Results show that this \commstr{} works pretty well for this problem.

For this strategy, new solvers were built reusing same \ms{} used for the \commstrs{} exposed before, and another different neighborhood \om{}: $V_{BP}(p)$, which given a configuration, returns the neighborhood $V\left(s\right)$ by swapping the culprit player chosen for all $p$ randomly selected weeks with other players in the same week. This new solver was called \textit{partial solver}, and it descends quicker the cost of its current solution at the beginning because its neighborhood generates less values, but the convergence is slower and yet not sure. It was combined with the solver used for the \commstrs{} exposed before. It was called \textit{full solver}, and converges in a stable way to the solution. So, the partial solver uses the same neighborhood function that the full solver, but parametrized in such a way that it builds neighbors only swapping players among two weeks. 

The idea of the \commstr{} is to communicate a configuration from the partial solver to the full solver. Here, the receiver solvers receive a configuration from a sender solver, and match it with their current configuration. Then it selects the configuration with the lowest global cost. This operation is coded using the \textit{minimum} operator $\poslop{m}$ in Algorithm~\ref{as:golfers_full}. This way, the full solver continues the search from a more promising place into de search space. After some iterations, is the full solver who sends its configuration to the partial solver. The partial solver takes this received configuration and starts its search from it and finds quickly a much better configuration to send to the full solver again. To force the partial solver to take the received configurations over its own, we use the \textit{not null} operator together with the \opch{} $C.M.$ (Algorithm~\ref{as:golfers_partial}). This process is repeated until a solution is found.

Figure~\ref{fig:solversgolfers} shows a full solver's run versus a partial solver's run. In this chart we can see that, at the beginning of the run, found configurations by the partial solver have costs significantly lower than those found by the full solver. \tet{At the 60-th millisecond} the full solver current configuration has cost 123, and the partial solver's one, 76. So for example, the communication at this time, can accelerate the process significantly.

We also design different \commstrs, combining connected and unconnected solvers in different percentages, and applying two different \commopers: \oneTone{} and \oneTn.

This strategy produces some gain in terms of runtime as we can see in Tables~\ref{tab:golfers_v2_1N} and \ref{tab:golfers_v2_11} with respect to Table~\ref{tab:golfersB001}. It produces also more robust results in terms of runtime. The spread of results in iterations show higher variances, because there are included also results of partial solvers, which performs many times more iterations that the full solvers. The percentage of the receiver solvers that were able to find the solution before the others did, was significant (see Appendix~\ref{app:sgp}). That shows that the communication played an important role during the search, despite inter--process communication's overheads (reception, information interpretation, making decisions, etc).

The code for the \commstr{} of 100\% of communicating solvers is presented in Algorithm~\ref{comm:golfers_v2_100} and for 50\% of communicating solvers in Algorithm~\ref{comm:golfers_v2_50}.
